<h1>Sales Landing Page Editor (Beta) - Information for Partners</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
Steam has a set of tools for creating and configuring a custom sale landing page that you can use to
highlight games for a special sale, game festival, or digital companion for a physical convention.
This feature needs to be enabled by Valve for your developer or curator group.<br /><br /><a

><br /><br />Sales page Events are made up of two parts: <br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        <strong>The announcement</strong> - This is the part of the event that shows up as 'news' on
        your group's page and in the News Hub for any users that follow your group or developer
        homepage.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>The landing page</strong> - The sale event page itself that features the games,
        broadcasts, and/or events that you configure.
    </li>
</ol>
<br />The documentation below provides instructions, templates and guidelines, but before you start
working on your sale page, please review these best practice suggestions:<br /><br /><strong
    >Do:</strong
>
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Make sure the purpose of your event is clear from all of the artwork (see "Banner&amp;
        Templates" below), so that any user who sees the artwork or lands on the page immediately
        understands what they’re looking at. <br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Use the page layout tools to categorize your games and content in a way that will make
        browsing easy for players.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Localize any text or calls to action (or reach out to Valve in advance to get localization
        assistance). <br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Preview your page and ‘playtest’ it with friends or colleagues before the event begins, to
        proofread and gather feedback.
    </li>
</ul>
<br /><br /><strong>Do Not: </strong><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Do not specifically reference any price or currency in your artwork. Customers will see
        different currencies based on what country they’re in, so putting a specific price in your
        art assets can be confusing or misleading. <br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Do not use the Steam sale event page to send users off Steam to another store or website.
        Offers being made on your Steam sale event page should be directly accessible to the player.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="started"></a>Getting Started</h2>
Sale landing pages are built on top of Steam Community groups such as for Developers homepages or
Steam Curators. There is a setting that needs to be enabled specifically by someone at Valve to
unlock the new event tools and then another setting to enable the sale page tools for a specific
event.<br /><br /><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        You need to have created one of the following:<br />
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>
                <a
                    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/creator_homepage"
                    class="bb_doclink"
                    >Developer or publisher homepage</a
                ><br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <a
                    href="https://store.steampowered.com/about/curators/"
                    target="_blank"
                    rel="noreferrer"
                    >Steam Curator page</a
                >
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Your Steam account needs to have 'Officer' level rights within the group associated with
        your developer or publisher or curator homepage (<a
            href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2092-QLZX-8453"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >Group Permission Documentation</a
        >)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Your Steam account cannot be a
        <a
            href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3330-iagk-7663"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >limited user account</a
        >.
    </li>
</ul>
<br /><br />To access the sales page feature, please navigate to your publisher or curator page on
Steam and click ADMIN (example URL:
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/daedalic/)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/daedalic/)</a
>. <br /><br /><img
    src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/admin.png"
    alt="admin.png"
    title="admin.png"
/><br /><br />It will take you to your homepage dashboard with various options for configuring your
developer or curator homepage. Click "view hidden announcements" on the left and you should see a
draft that has been created by Valve, or you'll need to create a new event and ask Valve to unlock
the sale page editor for it.<br /><br /><strong
    ><span style="color: #ca5029">Save often!</span></strong
><br />As a general guideline, make sure to hit SAVE at the bottom of the announcement/sales feature
tool, every time you make any changes - you can use the preview option right after the change has
been made:<br /><br /><img
    src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/image2020-4-17_12-41-2.png"
    alt="image2020-4-17_12-41-2.png"
    title="image2020-4-17_12-41-2.png"
/><br /><br />--<br /><br /><br />We will take you through the different tab options here now,
before getting to the sales page.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="description"></a>Description Tab</h2>
Since the sales feature is based on an announcement, please make sure you fill in that information
and upload the artwork for the announcement. The announcement will go live with the sales page and
will appear on your developer homepage or Steam Curator page as applicable. <br /><br /><strong
    >Best Practice:</strong
>
You generally want this description to talk about your sale event and provide a clear link to the
sale page.<br /><br /><img
    src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/description.png"
    alt="description.png"
    title="description.png"
/>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="options"></a>Options Tab</h2>
Set the event duration. Since it's a sale, run it in sync with your discounts. This will determine
when your event can start showing up and when it is considered 'concluded'. Note that regardless of
when you set your end date, the sale landing page will be accessible at any time in the future.<br /><br /><img
    src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/options.png"
    alt="options.png"
    title="options.png"
/>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Artwork Tab</h2>
Here, only the Cover Image will be required: 800px wide x 450px tall. You can use our cropping tool
to create other asset dimensions. There will be information around each image and where it will show
up. It's up to you if you want to include those additional images.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="broadcasting"></a>Broadcasting Tab</h2>
By default, broadcasting is disabled on sale landing pages, but you can add a 'broadcast' type
section to your page (further instructions below) to display livestreams. This 'broadcast' type
section will include livestreams from games that are part of your sale and from specific accounts
that you approve.<br /><br />This Broadcast tab enables you to approve and prioritize specific Steam
accounts for their livestreams to appear first in your broadcast section on your page. All active
streams will be shown on the sales page, with approved accounts appearing first and in the order you
select. Followed by any approved Stream associated with any game featured on your sales page.
<br /><br />For more information, please see
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/broadcast" class="bb_doclink"
    >Steam Broadcast Documentation</a
><br /><br /><img
    src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/broadcasting"
    alt="broadcasting"
    title="broadcasting"
/>
<h2 class="bb_subsection">
    <a name="3"></a>What happens when you have more than one Stream running at once?
</h2>
<br />Then Steam will alter the player to show a list of available streams on the right of the video
player. It will default to show the small capsule for the game being broadcasted and then show a
screenshot from the live broadcast when the user hovers over it. This allows Steam customers to
quickly browse through available live broadcasts.<br /><br />The capsules are presented in
descending viewer count order.<br /><br />The Broadcast that Steam chooses to automatically start
when the player is visible is determined by the following prioritization bucket order:<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Broadcasts from explicitly whitelisted accounts on the Broadcast tab of the sale (if any
        accounts are whitelisted)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Broadcasts who have a current live slot in the Event Schedule widget (if a schedule widget
        is included in the sales events). Note: Schedule widget is still in early development and
        you would need to Ask Valve to add it to your sale.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Any Official Broadcast associated with a game featured on the Sale page.</li>
</ul>
<br />If there are two or more broadcasts in any of the prioritization buckets, then Steam randomly
picks one from within the prioritization bucket. This at least provides a fair distribution of
viewers.<br /><br /><img
    src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/live_stream_widget.png"
    alt="live_stream_widget.png"
    title="live_stream_widget.png"
/>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="sale"></a>Sale Tab</h2>
<div class="bb_callout"><div>The Sale tab must be activated by Valve first.</div></div>
<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>
        Please publish your sale page to visible about 15 minutes before your intended start time.
        This will allow it enough time to complete the publish and clear our caching.
    </div>
</div>
<br />Once enabled, the Sale Tab will let you create and customize your landing page. At a high
level, a page is typically comprised of a background image that has your branding and artwork near
the top and a series of sections of content, which can be games, broadcasts, text, or links to other
pages.<br /><br />You can specify a custom URL, which will go live after you publish and will give
your page a space here:
<a
    href="http://store.steampowered.com/sale/*whateveryouchoosehere*"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >store.steampowered.com/sale/*whateveryouchoosehere*</a
><br /><br /><img
    src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/Sale.png"
    alt="Sale.png"
    title="Sale.png"
/>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="creatorhome"></a>Creator Home Widget</h2>
You can enable a widget showcasing your creator home to appear on the sale page. This allows Steam
users to easily follow your creator home and to see the various linked social media account.<br /><br /><img
    src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/sale1.png"
    alt="sale1.png"
    title="sale1.png"
/><br /><br />By default, Steam will place this near the top of your sale page, below the default
broadcast player (if there is a live stream) and before any sale section.<br /><br /><img
    src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/sale2.png"
    alt="sale2.png"
    title="sale2.png"
/><br /><br />However, you can control where this widget appears on the sale page by creating a sale
section and choosing the type 'Curator or Creator home'. This section will now appear above the
above widget and you can place this anywhere on the sale page. When this sale section exist then the
widget will not appear at the default location. You may create as many of these sections as needed.
You can choose to customize this section to point to other creator homes, for example, to high light
the related franchise pages with games on your sale page.<br /><br /><img
    src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/sale3_curator.png"
    alt="sale3_curator.png"
    title="sale3_curator.png"
/>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Sales page background</h2>
You can simply create a banner for the top and select a background color via our tool; or you can
create an entire background asset (recommended). The only limitation we have is that the file must
not exceed 3MB. Just to get you a rough idea, you can run the background image at 1789pixels width
and then fade it into one color going down – you can then pick the background color that it fades
into (HEX Color Code) and have it continue all the way to the bottom of the page. For example:<br /><br /><img
    src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/salebackground.png"
    alt="salebackground.png"
    title="salebackground.png"
/>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Adding your games</h2>
Games are organized on your page in one or more sections. These sections can be set to manually
include a specific set of games or can be set to smartly pull from a master list specified at the
top of your page (master list must be enabled by Valve first).<br /><br /><img
    src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/salesection.png"
    alt="salesection.png"
    title="salesection.png"
/><br /><br />To add a section, click the blue 'add section' button near the bottom of the Sale tab.
Once you add a section, you can specify what kind of content should be in that section.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Default Section Types</h2>
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>Items</strong> - These are apps, packages, or bundles. They can be organized into
        grids or carousels or can display a single item if you wish.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Events</strong> - These are events posted via the Steam Events &amp; Announcements
        tool.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Links</strong> - Add links to other parts of the Steam Store. For each link, you can
        provide an image. These can be organized into grids or carousels or just a single banner
        image.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Broadcast Player</strong> - This will play the broadcasts from any of the games
        listed within your sale page. It will randomize which broadcast to start on. Note: If you
        use the broadcast tab mentioned above to specify accounts, those accounts will take priority
        within the broadcast player and will appear first in the listing.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Event Description</strong> - This will display the same text that you entered on the
        'Description' tab.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Text Section</strong> - This will let you enter and format text with BBCode tools.
        This can be pretty powerful and flexible if you need to display tables, YouTube Videos,
        banner images, or just blocks of text.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Curator or Creator Home Section</strong> - This will display a section with the
        selected Steam Curator or developer/publisher homepage, along with a 'follow' button and any
        linked social media accounts.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Event Schedule</strong> - This can be used to display events scheduled during the
        selected times by games listed on your page. If there is an active event with type
        'livestream', that game's broadcast will take priority in the broadcast player.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>Experimental Section Types</h2>
These sections types must first be enabled by Valve<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>Tabs</strong> - If you have an event with more than 50-100 games, you probably want
        to split the content up into different tabs. You can use tabs to organize your page by
        genre, category, theme, or any other way that makes sense for the games included in your
        event.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Sale Item Browser</strong> - Also useful for large events with many games, the Sale
        Item Browser will enable a tabbed section for automatically listing games by 'top seller',
        'new release', 'most wishlisted', 'trending', and others.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="8"></a>Section Options</h2>
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>Section Title</strong> - You can choose from a list of titles that are already
        translated and ready to go, or you can enter a custom title. Make sure you save your custom
        title separately, by clicking "Save Title" next to it.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Background Settings</strong> - You can customize the background color of each
        section, and even provide an image if you wish. This can help set each section apart from
        the others.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Tab Settings</strong> - If you have tabs turned on for your page, you can specify
        which tabs each section should appear under. By default, a section will appear under all
        tabs unless you specify one or more.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="9"></a>Adding Games</h2>
At the bottom of a section, you will see a field "FEATURED ITEMS" this is where you add your apps -
simply search for them or enter the appID.<br /><br />Alternatively, you can turn on "Smart Section"
and then pick from a few options for automatically populating this section from any game in the sale
page<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>Show Featured Items from user's wishlist</strong> - Automatically shows any included
        games from the wishlist of the person viewing the page.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Show Featured Items suggested by interactive recommender</strong> - Automatically
        shows any included games recommended for the person viewing the page.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Show discounted items with this tag</strong> - Automatically show any included game
        that is on discount and matches the specified tag.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Show discounted items in this category</strong> - Automatically show any included
        game that is on discount and matches the specified category (eg. Singleplayer, Co-op, Steam
        Workshop, Achievements, etc.)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Plus, a variety of experimental ways of automatically selecting games. Talk to your Valve
        contact if you have ideas about what you'd like, as it may already exist.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="visibility"></a>Visibility</h2>
Sale landing pages may be accessed in a number of ways, and some of these ways require discussion
and approval from Valve:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>Custom URL</strong> - The custom URL that you give your sale page will work as a
        great way for you to link to the sale from your website or other marketing activities you
        have planned.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Event Announcement</strong> - A link from the announcement portion of your event
        will lead players to your page. Visibility of your announcement itself depends on which
        group is used to create the event. For example, if an event is created under your publisher
        account and you have a lot of followers of your publisher, then those players will discover
        your announcement in their News Hub and activity feeds.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Front page</strong> - Front page visibility must be discussed with Valve. For
        standard sale promotions like Weekend Deals and Midweek Madness, this visibility is part of
        the promotion. But if the sale landing page is to be used for a convention or festival, then
        front page visibility will depend on your event, it's relevance to Steam's global audience,
        the games that are included in your event, and what the call-to-action is for players.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Store Page Banners</strong> - Store page banners allow for a banner to appear on
        each of the games listed within a sale page. This can help direct players that discover an
        individual game to explore more of your overall event. The use of store page banners depends
        on the event and what other events are happening at the same time. Use of these must be
        discussed with Valve.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="examples"></a>Examples</h2>
Most of the features described above have information next to them on where they will show up and
what they do. To get you a better idea though, we've compiled a couple of visual examples below and
links to some great sales pages that were built with this new feature:<br /><br />Sales Page<br /><img

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="faq"></a>FAQ</h2>
<strong>Q. How do we prioritize a live-stream to be the default on our page?</strong><br />A. If you
make use of the 'Broadcasting" tab to configure your whitelist of accounts to live-stream to your
page, those streams will be prioritized above any of the streams from individual games that are
streaming during your event.<br /><br /><strong
    >Q. Do I need to publish the announcement portion of the event in order to make my sale page
    live?</strong
><br />A. Yes, you need to hit the 'publish' button in order for your sale landing page to become
publicly visible, and the announcement will also go public at the same time. So please fill in the
'description' tab with thoughtful content as well.<br /><br /><strong
    >Q. How can I show/hide my creator home widget? Can I control where it appears?</strong
><br />A. Yes to all.<br /><br />This feature is enabled the default location (near top of the page)
via the 'General Page Configuration' panel within the right hand panel 'Show creator capsule for
this event'. This is off by default, however, you can enable it. <br /><br />You can also control
the location where this widget appears by creating a regular sale section and then changing what
should be featured in this section to "Curator or Creator Home section". You can create as many of
these sections and it can refer to other curator or creator homes than the hosting group.<br />
