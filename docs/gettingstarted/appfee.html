<h1>Steam App Fee</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
Whether you are completing the Steam Direct signup process or are already an
established Steamworks developer, you can now simply pay a $100 USD (or
equivalent) fee for each new app you wish to distribute on Steam. Read below for
details on how it works.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Onboard On Steamworks</h2>
When you are signing up as a Steamworks developer for the first time, you'll
need to complete a set of digital paperwork. One of the steps in that paperwork
is to pay the Steam App Fee, which you can do with any payment method that Steam
supports in your country. <br /><br />You will be directed to the Steam store to
complete the transaction, and then directed back to the Steamworks website to
continue with your paperwork. See

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Purchasing And Activating App Credit</h2>
Steamworks developers can easily buy additional app credits to prepare your next
games for release on Steam. <br /><br />The Steam App Fee may be paid with any
payment method that Steam supports in your country, excluding Steam wallet
funds. Once the Steam App Fee is paid, an app credit will be attached to the
Steam account of the person who paid the fee. The credit can only be activated
by the person who paid the app fee.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Recouping The App Fee</h2>
The Steam App Fee is not refundable, but will be recoupable in the payment made
after your product has at least $1,000.00 Adjusted Gross Revenue for Steam Store
and in-app purchases. Payment of revenue from sales and repayment of fee may be
withheld if deposit payment is charged-back, refunded, or otherwise identified
as fraudulent.<br />
