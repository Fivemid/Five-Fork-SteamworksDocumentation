<h1>Transferring Applications</h1>
If you need to transfer a game or other application to another Steamworks partner account, it can be
done entirely through a set of tools built into the Steamworks website. These tools manages the
approval process and keeps a history of transfers.<br /><br />Transfers may be useful in cases such
as when a game changes ownership, or if an individual forms a corporation and needs to move the game
to be distributed under the new corporation.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Necessary permissions and configuration</h2>
To complete a transfer of a game with Steamworks, there are some requirements:<br /><br /><strong
    >The Steam User that initiates the transfer:</strong
><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        must have Actual Authority permission within Steamworks for the Steamworks partner account
        that has current distribution rights for the game.<br />
    </li>
    <li>needs to know the e-mail address of the recipient of the transfer.</li>
</ul>
<br /><strong>The Steam User that receives the transfer :</strong><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        must be attached to a complete, verified, and fully onboard Steamworks partner account and
        have Actual Authority permission within that Steamworks account. <br />(Note: If you already
        have a partner account, but need to make changes to who is listed as Actual Authority,
        please use our

    </li>
    <li>
        if the recipient does not have a fully onboard partner account, one can sign up through

tool, which can also be found under the "Tools" menu on the Steamworks website. You will need to be
the Actual Authority of your Steamworks partner account to complete an app transfer.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Steps of the transfer</h2>
A transfer consists of five steps. The length of the entire process depends on how long it takes the
recipient and transferer to confirm the transfer. Once both parties have fully approved the app
transfer, Valve will need to approve the transfer. Valve will do so as quickly as possible, usually
within 2-7 business days.<br /><br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        Transferer initiates the transfer. The existing manager of an app will:<br />
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>enter the e-mail address of the recipient to initiate the transfer .<br /></li>
            <li>
                choose an effective date for the transfer, see more about the effective date
                below.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                provide a reason for the transfer so Valve can more easily review and approve the
                transfer.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Recipient approves the transfer. The recipient will:<br />
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>
                receive an e-mail notifying of the pending transfer. That e-mail leads to the App
                Transfer Tool under the "Tools" menu in Steamworks. <br />
            </li>
            <li>see any pending transfers initiated by other partners. <br /></li>
            <li>
                need to have Actual Authority for the Steamworks partner account to complete an app
                transfer.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Transferer re-confirms the transfer.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Valve will review the transfer. If there are questions about the reason for the transfer, we
        will email the actual authority users to obtain more information. <br />
    </li>
    <li>Transfer complete. Once approved, all management rights transfer to the new partner.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Effective Date</h2>
The effective date of a transfer is the date that payments will begin to the new partner.<br /><br />The
effective date is not the date that management rights transfer to the new partner. Management rights
will transfer immediately upon approval by Valve.<br /><br />The system defaults to an effective
date of 7 days from the date the transfer is initiated.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>FAQ</h2>
<h4>Q. Can I set when the new company will start receiving payments?</h4>
A. Only the initiator can set the effective date which is when payments will begin to the receiving
party once the transfer request is approved by Valve.<br /><br />You may wish to choose a particular
date to conform to your contract, but we find that for accounting purposes, the 1st of the current
or following month may be a convenient date for some partners.<br /><br />We do not recommend and
may not allow dates far in advance of the current date or dates earlier than the 1st of the current
month.
<h4>Q. How long does the app transfer process take?</h4>
A. Once both parties have fully approved the app transfer, Valve will respond to the request as
quickly as possible. Usually within 2-7 business days.
<h4>Q. Can I transfer multiple applications in one request? Can I transfer DLC?</h4>
A. Yes, you can select multiple applications and DLC to transfer in a single request.
<h4>
    Q. Transferee accepted the transfer, but it is still "Awaiting Confirmation From Transferer",
    what do I do?
</h4>
A. The transferer or initiator should have received an email with a link to confirm the transfer. If
you cannot find it, you can cancel and repeat the process. If that doesn't work please create a
support ticket.
<h4>Q. What happens to the store page, community hub, user reviews, etc?</h4>
A. All public elements of the appID will remain exactly the same after the transfer, and customer
ownership is not interrupted or changed. Once the transfer completes, the new owner of the appID can
edit the store page, edit the Publisher field, upload new assets, update the build, change the price
and so on. But everything will stay the same until the new owner makes changes. No community content
(user reviews, forums, etc) will be affected by the transfer.<br /><br />Additionally, the app will
remain linked to any
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/creator_homepage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Developer or Publisher Homepages</a
>
that it has been linked to in the past.
<h4>Q. Can I run a discount on a game right away once transfer has been completed?</h4>
A. Transferred games are subject to the same discount cool-down timing as normal. This cool-down
does not get reset or shortened by the app transfer process. For more details, please see
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/discounts#5" class="bb_doclink"
    >Discounting Rules</a
>.
<h4>
    Q. When I receive the transfer of a game, will I have access to all sales history for the game?
</h4>
A. By default, you will only have access to sales data from the transfer effective date forward.
Visibility of full sales history can be granted to the recipient. If this is necessary, please have
the original manager of the game contact Valve to request that full history be granted to the new
recipient of the game.<br /><br />Monthly payment reports and history belongs to the former partner
and this information is not transferred.
<h4>
    Q. What happens to a game appearing on a Developer or Publisher Homepage when it's been
    transferred (aka Creator Home pages )?
</h4>
A. When a transfer is initiated for an appID, the appID will automatically be removed from all
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/creator_homepage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Developer or Publisher Homepages</a
>
that it is currently listed on. Once the transfer is complete, the appID can be listed on the new
Developer/Publisher Homepage.
<h4>Q. What happens to a game's wishlist or followers during a transfer?</h4>
A. Nothing. The wishlists and followers are tied to the game and will be preserved if ownership is
transferred.
<h4>Q. Will the new owner be able to see financial data from before the transfer?</h4>
A. By default, financial information is only visible to partners from time periods that they were
paid for the game. Therefore, the new owner will see financial information only from the point of
transfer and not before. To share financial viewing rights, please see
