<h1>Store Widget</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
For any game with a visible purchase option in the Steam store, you can create a widget with
information about your product, current price, any discounts, and a purchase button to help you
promote and display your title anywhere.<br /><br /><img

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Creating your Widget</h2>
To create your Steam widget, you will need to head over to your public store page in Steam. This
widget will keep up to date as you change your product price or discount, add platforms, or update
your branding image. Clicking the "Buy on Steam" button from the widget will take customers to the
Steam website with the item in their cart where they can easily complete the purchase process and
pay with whatever method they prefer, including funds from their Steam Wallet.<br /><br />Creating a
Steam widget for an unreleased game will generate a widget with an "Add to Wishlist" button instead
of a "Buy on Steam" button.<br /><br />

        On the right-hand side of your product page in the Steam Store, click the "Embed" button.
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If you have more than one purchase option, you will be prompted to pick which of your
        purchase options (and price) you wish your widget to display.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        You will also see a box that is pre-populated with the first part of your product
        description. You can edit this to say whatever you want about your product.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Hit "Create Widget".<br /></li>
    <li>
        You will now see a preview of your widget along with the HTML, which you will need to copy
        and paste into your website or blog where you wish to display it.<br /><br />
    </li>
