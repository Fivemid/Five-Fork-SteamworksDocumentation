        <h5>In Brief</h5>
        Players can add your game to their wishlist on Steam to keep track of games they are
        interested in. When your game releases or goes on discount, those players automatically
        receive a notification.
        <h5>Level of integration</h5>
        None required, aside from creating your store page.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
Once your game has a publicly visible store page listed within Steam, players may begin adding your
game to their wishlist. Prior to the release of your game, this gives you a place to point your fans
and interested players where they can take action to express their interest and keep track of your
game. Along the way, this gives you a sense of the level of interest by potential customers and a
way of notifying interested customers when your game releases or goes on discount.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Wishlist Notifications</h2>
Email notifications may be sent to customers based on a variety of trigger actions related to your
game, software, or video on Steam. These triggers may change in the future, but this is a
description of current set of features.<br /><br />Discount e-mails typically send within a few
hours of your product's release or discount. In high volume e-mail periods, time to notification
will be longer. <br /><br />Customers who have been notified about your game within the last week
(including "now available" e-mails from product launches) will be on e-mail cooldown, and will not
receive additional communication until the week-long period has passed. <br /><br />Note that
customers must have verified their e-mail account to receive messages, and that some customers may
have opted to configure their e-mail preferences to not receive some or all of these kinds of
e-mails.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Product Launches (Release or Early Access)</h2>
When your game releases, either in Early Access or as Full Release, any user that has the game on
their wishlist at that time will receive an e-mail notification about the game being available.<br /><br />If
your game has released in Early Access and then transitions to Full Release, another e-mail will be
sent to users with the game on their wishlist at that time.<br /><br />For more information on
preparing for release, please see the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/releasing" class="bb_doclink">Release Process</a>
documentation.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Promotional Discounts</h2>
Any type of discount at or above 20%, whether a curated feature spot, a weeklong deal, or a custom
configured discount will trigger a notification e-mail to users with your game on their wishlist.
<br /><br />Discounts must, at a minimum, affect the lowest priced package for a game. For example,
if you have a $20 Regular and $30 Deluxe package for your game, just discounting the the Deluxe
package would not trigger wishlist notification e-mails, you would also need to discount the Regular
package. <br /><br />Discounts must be global. There may be different packages across regions, but
all regions must be discounted. <br /><br />Discounts must be over 8 hours in duration, and may not
be over one week old. <br /><br />For more information on discounts, please see the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/discounts" class="bb_doclink">Discounting</a>
documentation.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Your Wishlist Data</h2>
Within each app's details page on the
<a href="https://partner.steampowered.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Sales &amp; Activation Reports Portal</a
>, you'll find a section for "Wishlists". This section tracks additions, purchases, and deletions by
users that have your game on their wishlist. Additionally, you can see a breakdown of wishlist
numbers by region or country in the "Regional sales report" section for each app. Wishlist data is
updated daily for the previous date (ie. as of March 2nd, you can see all of the data up to March
1st)<br /><br />You can also find some past analysis of wishlist behavior written up in the
Steamworks Developer Group

time.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="6"></a>Best Practices</h2>
Here’s our three biggest suggestions:<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        Put up a Coming Soon page as soon as you’re ready and able, so interested customers can add
        your product to their wishlist and get notified at launch.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Stay engaged over time—don’t just launch your game and move on to the next one. Many users
        will wait for a reason to buy your title, such as a transition out of Early Access, a
        content update, discount, or a friend to play the game with.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Look back at Wishlist data after a sale or promotional event to guide your future decisions.
        Trends over time can help you determine what communication is generating the most interest,
        both in terms of purchases and wishlists.
