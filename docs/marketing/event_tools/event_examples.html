<h1>Events and Announcements Examples</h1>
As part of the Steam Library update, coming September 17th, we’ve improved the look and feel of your
event and announcement pages, along with the authoring tools for creating them. Below is an example
of one of these revamped event pages, and how it will appear under your page’s Recent Updates.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Cover Image</h2>
<strong>A portal to your event/announcement.</strong><br /><br />The
<strong>cover image</strong> asset is used to represent your event/announcement in a number of
places across Steam, including on the store page for your game and in the Steam Client Library. It's
used to link to your event/announcement and may be displayed alongside content from multiple games,
so the image should be clear and recognizable.<br /><br />Alongside the cover image, Steam will
always include your game's name and icon, so you do not need to include this information within the
image. Instead, it is recommended that the image concisely represents your announcement, including
any announcement specific graphics or branding. Example: to take a specific event like TI6, Valve
would create a cover image focusing on "The International" rather than a generic use of "Dota 2".<br /><br />Example
cover images:<br /><br /><img

    alt="capsule_examples.jpg"
    title="capsule_examples.jpg"
/><br /><br /><br />When viewed inside the Steam Library:<br /><br /><img

    alt="event_example_home_862.jpg"
    title="event_example_home_862.jpg"
/>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Event/Announcement Detail Page</h2>
<strong>The guts of your event/announcement.</strong><br />Users will click through the
<strong>cover image</strong> (described above) to read the Event Detail page.
<br /><br /><br />There are two primary parts to the Event Detail page:
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Event Header</h2>
An <strong>event header image</strong> can be provided for each event or announcement that you post.
This graphic is optional but increases the prominence of your major updates. If provided, the
graphic should include images and logos/branding related to your update.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Event Body</h2>
Users can interact with the <strong>event body section</strong> of your announcement. So, in
addition to text and static images, feel free to include Steam Store widgets or YouTube videos.<br /><br /><img

/>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Steam Library - Game Details Page</h2>
Your game details page in the Steam Library includes three image types to convey information about
the state of your game.<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li><strong>Hero image</strong> - Reflects the branding/art for your game<br /></li>
    <li>
        <strong>Spotlight image</strong> - Features a "can't miss" event/announcement for your
        users<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Cover image</strong> - Shown as a historical view of your event/announcement posts
    </li>
</ul>
<br /><br /><img

    title="event_example_detailpg_862.jpg"
/>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Hero Image and Game Logo</h2>
The <strong>hero image</strong> supplied for your game will act as the branding/header for your game
details page and as a visual anchor representing where a user is within the Steam Client. Users will
expect this image to be consistent, recognizable, and an accurate representation of your game's
brand. Therefore it should not include any text or other messaging related to most events or
announcements. In most cases, to alert the user to new information, you'll want to use the
<strong>spotlight image</strong> described below.<br /><br />In the rare case, you may want to
change your hero image to reflect <strong>major changes in your game</strong>. Some scenarios for
updating your library hero image are:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>major content update<br /></li>
    <li>the start of a new game season<br /></li>
    <li>addition of a new game character<br /></li>
    <li>a long running seasonal event (a multi-week Halloween or Christmas update)</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>Spotlight Image</h2>
A <strong>spotlight image</strong> can optionally be included to prominently display your event or
announcement to all of your users. The image will sit near the top and span the full width of the
game details page. If a user clicks on your spotlight image, they will view the
<strong>Event/Announcement Detail Page</strong>.<br /><br />If there are multiple spotlights posted
in a short period of time, Steam will always display the most recent spotlight, unless that recent
spotlight is more than a month or two old (or if the end date for a timed event has passed). The
spotlight will disappear for a particular player a day or two after they have viewed it in their
library.<br /><br />The spotlight image should focus on the content of your event and should include
a call to action for the user. The call to action could be as simple as stating that your major
update is available now or as detailed as letting the user know the exact times an event or
broadcast are available.<br /><br />The <strong>spotlight image</strong> can be presented in two
ways. You can choose to provide an image that occupies the entire spotlight space (see the example
above) or you can position your branding toward the left of the image and let the Steam Client place
your event title and summary over the right side of your image (see the example below).<br /><br /><img

    alt="example_spotlight_autotext.jpg"
    title="example_spotlight_autotext.jpg"
/>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="8"></a>Cover Image</h2>
Your <strong>cover image</strong> is reused alongside the event Title and Summary when displaying
previous events/announcements in the user's Activity Feed. <br /><br /><img
