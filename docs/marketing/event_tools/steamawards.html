<h1>Steam Awards Nomination Tool</h1>
During the Steam Autumn Sale, your fans can nominate your game for a Steam Awards category. You can
use the Steam Event system to encourage your community to nominate your game. If you specify a
nomination category, it will provide your fans with an easy "Nominate" button embedded inside the
event page.

<br />To get started, use the Event Dashboard to create a new event and choose the "Steam Awards
Nomination Suggestion" category.<br /><br /><br /><img

    title="2019-11-22_14-41-11.png"
/><br /><br /><br /><br />In this event, the "Options" tab will require you to choose which category
to suggest to your fans. You can also select "No Category", which will let fans select their own.
<br /><br />Only games released since the previous year's Autumn Sale will be able to select any
category. Games released earlier than last year's Autumn Sale will only be eligible for the 'A Labor
of Love' category.<br /><br /><br /><br /><img

/><br /><br /><br /><br />Your fans will see a section near the top of the event about the Steam
Awards. It will have an easy to use call-to-action to nominate your game. This event will appear on
your product page on the Steam Store, your Steam Community page, and the Library detail page for
your game. It will not appear on the Library Home 'What's New' section.<br /><br /><br /><br /><img
