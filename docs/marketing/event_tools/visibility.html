<h1>Events and Announcements Visibility</h1>
This document describes where various types of events can appear.<br /><br />Events
are your communication channel with your players and prospective players on
Steam. You can author a single event with images and metadata attached to it,
and it will automatically be pushed out to all the relevant locations across
Steam.<br /><br /><img

/><br /><br />Events appear in three main areas of Steam:<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
  <li>
    <strong>Steam Community</strong> - Events appear on your community hub and
    in the activity feed of players that follow your game.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Steam Store</strong> - Events appear on your game's store page and
    on the homepage when used with an
    <a
      href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/https%3A//partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/visibility#update"
      class="bb_doclink"
      >Update Visibility Round</a
    >.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Steam Library</strong> - Events can appear on the library homepage
    and on your game's library detail page for players that play your game.
  </li>
</ol>
<br />When you create an event, you are asked to select the most appropriate
category for your event, which will impact how it looks, what data fields are
available, and where that event will be surfaced. Visibility of these events
depends on where we see that players are ready to receive each type of
communication and whether they are in the right context to take action on that
event.
<h2 class="bb_section">
  <a name="libraryhome"></a>Library Homepage Visibility
</h2>
This is also known as to the 'What's New' section that is pinned to the top of
their Library Home Page. It is intended to communicate to Steam players about
content for games in their library, for example, updates, tournaments, DLCs and
in-game events. The purpose to keep the Steam players aware of all of the cool
and exciting things that are happening in their library. It may encourage them
to re-engage with a game they haven't played in a while. However, it is not
intended to be a place to advertise other products or services.<br /><br />Steam
players have the ability to personalize the games and event types they will see.
They can increase or decrease the frequency of events about game that appear
their 'What's New' section. <br /><br />To present the best event to your fan on
their home, you need to be mindful of when older events should no longer appear
in this section. You can control homepage visibility of older events in two
ways:<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
  <li>
    When you publish a new event, we will present you a dialog showing the other
    events that are visible in the homepage and let you choose to hide older
    ones.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    You can always manage homepage visibility from the Events and Announcement
    Dashboard
  </li>
</ul>
<div class="bb_callout">
  <div>
    Don't fret, those "hidden" events are not deleted. They continue to appear
    in chronological order within your game's Library Detail page or
    chronologically appear anywhere the Steam players engages with a past event
    and they can scroll to see those older events
  </div>
</div>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="1"></a>When to Hide Older Events</h2>
Ideally, you should only have a single or maximum two events that can be visible
on the homepage. Steam Players seeing a bunch of old events may tire them and
teach them to ignore your content. <br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
  <li>
    Some events allow your to specific an end-time. Steam will automatically
    remove those events from appearing in the homepage, so no action is needed
    on your part. You can always opt to make them disappear sooner, especially
    for long running events.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    When dropping multiple teasers related to an upcoming launch or major event.
    In these case, when the new teaser is published, it is ideal to remove the
    old teaser. This helps keep the homepage fresh and exciting for your
    fans.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    When creating a sequence of events post about a progress toward a larger
    event. For example, posting daily (or more often) about the results of an
    on-going tournament. In these cases, users would likely only want to know
    the latest announcement.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Exceptions</h2>
For the most part, all events appear in all places, but there are some
exceptions for certain kinds of events that don't make sense to show to players
in certain contexts.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Patchnotes</h2>
Small updates / Patchnotes intentionally don't appear in high-visibility
locations like the library homepage or your game's store page. This gives you a
way to publish a list of smaller or mundane changes to your game without pushing
it in front of all players. This way, players can more easily find your bigger
more important updates and announcements.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Sale/Discount Events</h2>
These events are intended to be for prospective players, so they appear
primarily in places where potential players will see them, such as on your
game's store page and in your community hub. Events about discounts on your game
do not appear to existing players in their library since they already own your
game.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Cross-promotion</h2>
Events and announcements that are primarily about other games or other
stores/platforms need to be categorized as Cross Promotion. This will allow
those announcements to appear to your most engaged fans on your community hub
and in the activity feed of followers. These events do not appear on the library
homepage or on your store page.<br /><br />
