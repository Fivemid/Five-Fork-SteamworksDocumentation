<h1>Sales Landing Page Editor (Beta) - Section Types</h1>
This document will discuss the various types of sections you can use on your sale page to display
different content.<br />
<br />
<strong>Adding a Section</strong><br />
To add a section to your page, click the blue 'add section' button near the bottom of the Sale tab.
Once you add a section, you can use the drop-down highlighted below to specify what kind of content
should be in that section.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Apps And Bundles</h2>
These are apps, packages, or bundles. They can be organized into grids or carousels or can display a
single item if you wish.<br />
<br />

<h6>Showing a 4-row grid set to display "2/3/4/3" format</h6>
<br />
If you set the rows and items-per-row each to "1" you can also choose different layout formats with
more information displayed about each game. For example, you can choose a format that runs the
microtrailer in the background and shows tags and reviews.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Text Section</h2>
This will let you enter and format text with bbcode tools. This can be pretty powerful and flexible
if you need to display tables, YouTube Videos, banner images, or just blocks of text.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>News And Events</h2>
These are events posted via the Steam Events &amp; Announcements tool<br />
<br />
<strong>Carousel of three items</strong><br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Dev/Publisher Home Page or Community Group Widget</h2>
This will display a section with the selected Steam Curator or developer/publisher homepage, along
with a 'follow' button and any linked social media accounts.<br />
<br />

    alt="sectionType_Publisher.jpg"
    title="sectionType_Publisher.jpg"
/>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Broadcast Player</h2>
This will play the broadcasts from any of the games listed within your sale page. It will randomize
which broadcast to start on. Note: If you use the broadcast tab mentioned above to specify accounts,
those accounts will take priority within the broadcast player and will appear first in the
listing.<br />
<br />

    alt="sectionType_Broadcast.jpg"
    title="sectionType_Broadcast.jpg"
/>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="schedule"></a>Event Schedule</h2>
This can be used to display events scheduled during the selected times by any game listed on your
page. The events that appear are ordered by their start time. If multiple events start at the same
time then their order is random. If there is an active event with type 'livestream', that game's
broadcast will take priority in the broadcast player at 'Featured' priority. Broadcast by games
included on the sale that aren't explicitly in the schedule will have the 'Default' priority.<br />
<br />
In the sale page editor, there are controls to setup the time range for the schedule, so that it can
be setup to be different than underlying sale event. The specific event types allowed can also be
configured here. <br />
<br />
The schedule does not have a way to limit the number of times a game can appear in the schedule. You
may need to coordinate/communicate with games appearing on the sale page some limit of events they
should create to be fair to all participants. <br />
<br />
To add to the schedule events tied to underlying festivities rather than the listed games, for
instance, a conference talk, then you need to create a 'Track' via the schedule editor. The track
permits adding published events directly using their public URLs. Which means, those schedule events
need to be published before you can add them to the schedule. Ideally, the events would create the
events from the same community group or creator home that is hosting the sale landing page. Each
entry on the schedule would require another event, which means re-broadcasts of the stream need to
have their own public event.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="6"></a>Tabs</h2>
If you have an event with more than 50-100 games, you probably want to split the content up into
different tabs. You can use tabs to organize your page by genre, category, theme, or any other way
that makes sense for the games included in your event.<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>Tabs as Filters</h2>
Once tabs are enabled, you can use each tab to filter content by applying a filter setting on the
tab configuration itself.<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="8"></a>Using tabs to hide/show sections</h2>
Or you can define sections listed below the tabs to display only when chosen tab(s) are active.<br />
<br />

/>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="9"></a>Links to other store pages</h2>
Add links to other parts of the Steam Store. For each link, you can provide an image. These can be
organized into grids or carousels or just a single banner image.<br />
<br />

/>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="10"></a>Sale Item Browser</h2>
(This section type must first be enabled by Valve)<br />
Also useful for large events with many games, the Sale Item Browser will enable a tabbed section for
automatically listing games by 'top seller', 'new release', 'most wishlisted', 'trending', and
others
