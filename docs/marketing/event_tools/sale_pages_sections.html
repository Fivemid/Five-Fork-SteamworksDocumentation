<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Broadcast Player</h2>
This will play the broadcasts from any of the games listed within your sale page. It will randomize
which broadcast to start on. Note: If you use the broadcast tab mentioned above to specify accounts,
those accounts will take priority within the broadcast player and will appear first in the
listing.<br /><br /><img

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Event Description</h2>
This will display the same text that you entered on the 'Description' tab.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="6"></a>Text Section</h2>
This will let you enter and format text with bbcode tools. This can be pretty powerful and flexible
if you need to display tables, YouTube Videos, banner images, or just blocks of text.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="7"></a>Curator or Creator Home Section</h2>
This will display a section with the selected Steam Curator or developer/publisher homepage, along
with a 'follow' button and any linked social media accounts.<br /><br /><img

/>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="8"></a>Event Schedule</h2>
This can be used to display events scheduled during the selected times by games listed on your page.
If there is an active event with type 'livestream', that game's broadcast will take priority in the
broadcast player.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="9"></a>Tabs</h2>
(This section type must first be enabled by Valve)<br />If you have an event with more than 50-100
games, you probably want to split the content up into different tabs. You can use tabs to organize
your page by genre, category, theme, or any other way that makes sense for the games included in
your event.<br /><br /><img

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="10"></a>Sale Item Browser</h2>
(This section type must first be enabled by Valve)<br />Also useful for large events with many
games, the Sale Item Browser will enable a tabbed section for automatically listing games by 'top
seller', 'new release', 'most wishlisted', 'trending', and others
