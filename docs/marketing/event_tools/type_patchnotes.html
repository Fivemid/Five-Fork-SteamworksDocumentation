<h1>Event Type: Small Update / Patch Notes</h1>
Within the Steam Events &amp; Announcements tools, there are three levels of category for game
updates: Patch Notes, Regular Updates, and Major Updates.<br /><br />Patch Notes are important for
letting your most engaged players know what has changed in your game, even if those changes are not
something most players would care about. Every time you push out a new build to Steam, your players
will see their game update in Steam. Many of those players want to see what has changed in the game,
so posting something about your update will at least tell players something about the magnitude of
the update.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Patch Notes Visibility</h2>
Patch Notes are specifically designed to show up just in the appropriate locations. They don't
appear on your store page and they won't appear at the top of the Library homepage in the "What's
New" section.<br /><br />Instead, these will be accessible when a player clicks to view updates from
the Steam client's download window. They will also show up in a compact format within your game's
library detail window.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Posting Patch Notes</h2>
To post your patch notes, visit your app's landing page in Steamworks and scroll down to
"Post/Manage Events &amp; Announcements". Clicking that option will take you to a screen to select
the type of event you wish to post. You can click on "A Game Update" to expand the options and then
select "Small Update / Patch Notes".
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Minimum Requirements</h2>
Patch notes are designed to be lightweight and easy to post. Therefore, you really only need to fill
out two fields: title and description.<br /><br />You can easily paste in your bullet list of notes,
switch to the 'publish' tab and hit publish.<br /><br />On top of that, there are various optional
settings if you want to provide more information or include images of things that have changed, but
are not needed in order to post your patch notes.
