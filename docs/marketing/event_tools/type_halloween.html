    >Steam Scream event documentation</a
>.<br /><br />Some game developers choose to run special events in their games during Halloween,
even if the game is not normally associated with ‘Horror’. With the tools available for events and
announcements, along with additional visibility for events and announcements in the Steam Library,
you have access to some great ways to communicate with your audience about limited-time
Halloween-themed content or activities taking place in your game.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Halloween Event Types</h2>
If you are adding new maps, skins, artwork, or other content to your game for Halloween, or running
limited-time events with special themed content, challenges, or other similar activities, please let
us know by selecting a "Halloween Event" using the Steam Events system when creating a new event or
announcement

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Halloween Event Visibility</h2>
These special Halloween-type events appear in the usual places such as your game's store page, in
your players' Steam Library, and in your game's Steam Community Hub. <br /><br />In addition, if a
game is opted in to participate in Steam Scream, these events are surfaced on the Halloween sale
page in a special section that shows recent events from all games, preferring games
owned/followed/wishlisted by the particular user and then falling back to top sellers.<br /><br />For
more information about Steam Scream and how to opt in and participate with an in-game event, please
