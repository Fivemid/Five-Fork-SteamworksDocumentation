<h1>Event Type: Halloween</h1>
Some game developers choose to run special events in their games during Halloween, even if the game
is not normally associated with ‘Horror’. With the tools available for events and announcements,
along with additional visibility for events and announcements in the Steam Library, you have access
to some great ways to communicate with your audience about limited-time Halloween-themed content or
activities taking place in your game. <br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Halloween Event Types</h2>
If you're adding new maps, skins, artwork, or other content to your game for Halloween, or running
limited-time events with special themed content, challenges, or other similar activities, please let
us know by selecting "Halloween Event" using the Steam Events system when creating a new event or
announcement (available beginning September 10). Documentation on creating Events and Announcements
is available
