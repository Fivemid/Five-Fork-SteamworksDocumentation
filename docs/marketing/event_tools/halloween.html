/><br /><br />Thanks for participating in the 2021 Steam Halloween Sale and Event!<br /><br />We
know that game developers run special events in their games during Halloween, even if the game is
not normally associated with ‘Horror’. With the new tools available for events and announcements,
along with additional visibility for events and announcements in the Steam Library you have some
great new ways to communicate with your audience about limited-time Halloween-themed content or
activities taking place in your game.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Halloween Event Types</h2>
If you are adding new maps, skins, artwork, or other content to your game for Halloween, or running
limited-time events with special themed content, challenges, or other similar activities, please let
us know by selecting a "Halloween Event" using the Steam Events system. We have set up a few common
categories for Halloween Events to provide even further detail:<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>New DLC or permanent addition to the game</strong><br />This can be free or paid,
        but should be used if the content will be available permanently, even after Halloween
        ends.<br /><i>Examples: New maps, New game-mode, etc</i><br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>In-Game Event</strong><br />Announce the time period for players to participate in
        some in-game activity to gain rewards or just to be together.<br />
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>
                <strong>XP Boost</strong><br />Announce a time when players will get extra points
                for playing your game.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Loot Event</strong><br />Announce a chance to find limited-time or new,
                rare, or unique loot. Or, increase availability of loot by participating players.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Perks Event </strong><br />Announce players having access to limited-time
                bonus or perks within game by completing tasks and/or participating in community
                events.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>In-Game Event </strong><br />Host a special in-game event with temporary
                Halloween-themed visuals.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Halloween Event Visibility</h2>
These special Halloween type events appear in the usual places such as your game's store page, in
your players' Steam Library, and in your game's Steam Community Hub. In addition, these events are
surfaced on the Halloween sale page in a special section that shows recent events from all games,
preferring games owned/followed/wishlisted by the particular user and then falling back to top
sellers.
