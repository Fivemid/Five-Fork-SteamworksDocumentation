<h1>Halloween Events</h1>
We know that game developers run special events in their games during Halloween, even if the game is
not normally associated with ‘Horror’. With the new tools available for events and announcements,
along with additional visibility for events and announcements in the Steam Library you have some
great new ways to communicate with your audience about limited-time Halloween-themed content or
activities taking place in your game. <br /><br />If you are adding new maps, skins, artwork, or
other content to your game for Halloween, or running limited-time events with special themed
content, challenges, or other similar activities, please let us know by selecting a "Halloween
Event" using the Steam Events system. We have set up a few common categories for Halloween Events to
provide even further detail:<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>New DLC or permanent addition to the game</strong><br />This can be free or paid,
        but should be used if the content will be available permanently, even after Halloween
        ends.<br /><i>Examples: New maps, New game-mode, etc</i><br /><br />
    </li>
