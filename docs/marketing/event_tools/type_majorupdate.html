<h1>Event Type: Major Update</h1>
Within the Steam Events &amp; Announcements tools, there are three levels of category for game
updates: Patch Notes, Regular Updates, and Major Updates.<br /><br />Major Updates are designed for
use in communicating your biggest game updates and signaling to players that this is one of the
biggest moments in the year for your game.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Major Update Visibility</h2>
Major update type events can appear in all the regular places, including store page, community hub
and Steam Library. These posts will show up to players that follow your game and will qualify to
show up in the "What's New" section for your fans at the top of the Steam Library homepage.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Posting Major Updates</h2>
To post about your major update, visit your app's landing page in Steamworks and scroll down to
"Post/Manage Events &amp; Announcements". Clicking that option will take you to a screen to select
the type of event you wish to post. You can click on "A Game Update" to expand the options and then
select "Major Update".
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Minimum Requirements</h2>
Major Updates are designed to be prominent and exciting posts, intended to get your player base
excited about new content added to the game. With that in mind, you'll want to prepare a bit more
content for your post ahead of time.<br /><br />

><br /><br />Beyond these minimum requirements, you may want to craft the body of the post itself to
include lots of images, video, and rich description of the update. You can use BBCode to format your
post, and our tools support a number of ways of embedding interesting content within the post.
