<h1>Events and Announcements Review Step</h1>
When an event or announcement is first posted or updated, it goes through a quick routine review
step by Valve moderators. Until a post has been reviewed and confirmed, the post will not be visible
in the Steam Library, including on the Library homepage and on the game's Library detail page.
