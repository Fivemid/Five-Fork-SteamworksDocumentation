<br /><strong>Q: Are Early Access games eligible to participate in the Steam Game Festival?</strong
><br />A: Only games that have not released a playable build yet are eligible. If your game is
already released and available in Steam Early Access by the start of the festival, then your game is
not eligible to participate in the Steam Game Festival.<br /><br /><strong
    >Q: Do I need to have my game and store page reviewed in order to register?</strong
><br />A: Yes, your base game's store page must be publicly visible in order to complete
registration. The Valve curation team looks at each store page, including any screenshots, trailers,
and description in order to determine which games we will be highlighting during the festival.<br />
<br /><strong>Q. I've changed my plans. How do I cancel my registration?</strong><br />A. Just
return to the registration page for your game by inserting your appID at the end of this URL
