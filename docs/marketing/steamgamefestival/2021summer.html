<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Event Dates</h2>
<strong>Starts:</strong> Wednesday, June 16th, 2021 @ 10AM PDT<br /><strong>Ends:</strong> Tuesday,

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Press Event Details</h2>
If you have granted permission for us to share your demo and information with press, we’ll be
automatically granting access to select press starting June 7th. This will give outlets a chance to
explore participating games, play some of the demos, and reach out if they’d like to learn more
about your game ahead of the festival.<br /><br />Here are a couple of things to know about the
press event:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Press will be free to write about the included games starting on the 7th. Some may want to
        give players a preview of games they are excited about ahead of time.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        We’ll be handling getting the demo builds to press, so no action is necessary on your part.
        Just make sure you have a build of your demo uploaded, configured, and tested.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        You may want to submit your demo builds for review ahead of June 7th just so our review team
        can help make sure the demo is configured correctly for the best experience by the press
        that tries them out.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        This Press Preview will be conducted with a set of ~100 press outlets that we are
        specifically contacting for this purpose.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="10"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<br /><strong>Q: Are Early Access games eligible to participate in the Steam Next Fest?</strong
><br />A: Only games that have not released a playable build yet are eligible. If your game is
already released and available in Steam Early Access by the start of the festival, then your game is
not eligible to participate in the Steam Next Fest.<br /><br /><strong
    >Q: Do I need to have my game and store page reviewed in order to register?</strong
><br />A: Yes, your base game's store page must be publicly visible in order to complete
registration. The Valve curation team looks at each store page, including any screenshots, trailers,
and description in order to determine which games we will be highlighting during the festival.<br />
<br /><strong>Q. I've changed my plans. How do I cancel my registration?</strong><br />A. Just
return to the registration page for your game by inserting your appID at the end of this URL
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/optin/sale/game_festival_summer2021/&lt;appid&gt;"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >https://partner.steamgames.com/optin/sale/game_festival_summer2021/&lt;appid&gt;</a
>
and deselect the checkbox at the very bottom of the page to remove your game from the festival.
After opting out, if you have not released your game prior to a future Next Fest, you could
participate in that one assuming the rest of the eligibility requirements were met.<br />
