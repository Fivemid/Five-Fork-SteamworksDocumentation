<br /><strong>A Note on Future Events</strong><br />Based on feedback from players and developers,
we have decided to make the Steam Game Festival a recurring event. The tentative dates for the next
two events are February 2021 and June 2021. In order to make the selection of games as relevant as
possible for customers, beginning with the 2020 Steam Game Festival: Autumn Edition, games must meet
the following criteria to be eligible:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Games may only participate in one of the following events:
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>Autumn 2020<br /></li>
            <li><i>February 2021 (tentative)</i><br /></li>
            <li><i>June 2021 (tentative)</i></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Participating games must have a planned release date within 6 months of the festival. If you
        think your release date will be more than 6 months after the festival, you should plan to
        opt-in to a future event. Note that releasing into Early Access will still count as a
        release, since the game will be purchasable and playable by the Steam community.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Events</h2>
During the festival, we encourage you to schedule streaming or other events to interact with the
Steam community and show off your demo. During the Steam Game Festival, you'll be able to schedule
up to two live stream events which will appear on a calendar for players to browse. <br /><br />For

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="8"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<br /><strong>Q: Are Early Access games eligible to participate in the Steam Game Festival?</strong
><br />A: Only games that have not released a playable build yet are eligible. If you have a game
that will be coming to Early Access between October 13th and May, 2021, then your game is eligible.
If your game is already released and available in Steam Early Access, then your game is not eligible
to participate in the Steam Game Festival.<br /><br /><strong
    >Q: Do I need to have my game and store page reviewed in order to opt-in?</strong
><br />A: No, you need none of your pages or builds reviewed prior to opt-in. However, you may want
to build as much of your base game's store page as you can prior to opt-in so that Valve can learn
as much as possible about your game to decide where best to categorize your game and whether
additional feature opportunities apply.<br />
<br /><strong>Q. I've changed my plans. How do I opt my game back out?</strong><br />A. Just return
to the opt-in page for your game by inserting your appID at the end of this URL
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/optin/sale/game_festival_autumn2020/&lt;appid&gt;"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >https://partner.steamgames.com/optin/sale/game_festival_autumn2020/&lt;appid&gt;</a
>
and deselect the checkbox at the very bottom of the page to remove your game from the festival.<br />
