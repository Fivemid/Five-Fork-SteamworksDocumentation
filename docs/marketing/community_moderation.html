<h1>Community Moderation</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
Your Steam Community Hub is one of the many places your customers and fans are interacting,
discussing, and sharing their experiences with your product. It may be tempting to jump in and
participate in every conversation that is happening about your product. Instead, take a step back
and listen. Hear what your customers are discussing and asking. Rather than spending a bunch of
energy in replying to every thread, channel that energy and excitement into improving your product;
fix the bug, create new content, etc.<br /><br />In many cases, the presence of a developer
commenting in discussions can derail the conversation or cause participants to be more timid in
their responses. It is often more beneficial to let the community talk things through so that you
can gather more data about the issue or hear what kind of solutions your customers come up with.<br /><br />Here
are a couple points that we've found to be useful to keep in mind when browsing discussions:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Listen to your customers. Not just in the Steam Community, but everywhere people are talking
        about your product.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Don't respond to everything. Crafting deliberate and thoughtful communication takes time and
        always comes with risks of reducing future options or spurring further argument. Let your
        community answer each others' questions.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Work on your product. If there are a bunch of common themes in the discussions about bugs or
        issues in your game or software, then you probably have a good idea of what would have the
        best pay-off to fix or improve. The best communication is to change your product, as it
        reaches all your customers and generates the best feedback.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Don't argue with your fans. Some customers will try to engage developers in arguments.
        There's no way you can win.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Let customers express their unhappiness. Don't censor; customers know when that's happening.
        Focus on your product rather than getting worked up over negative comments. Channel your
        energy into fixing the core issues and making customers happy in the product.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />There are times where the productivity of a community can be hindered by particular
individuals or off-topic conversations. Use the guidelines below to appropriately decide whether to
delete, lock or merge threads and when to ban users. Many of these guidelines have huge pay-off in
terms of keeping your community clean and on track.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Global Moderation &amp; Reported Posts</h2>
Members of your community can report posts and threads to identify abuse or spam that is happening
in your Steam Discussions. On the right-hand side of your Discussion Hub you will see a sub-forum
listing for "Reported Posts". This section will show you all the posts that have been reported along
with the report description entered by the user. <br /><br />By default, all of this reported
content will be reviewed and resolved by Valve's moderation staff in conjunction with our Rules
&amp; Guidelines. Users who repeatedly violate these rules will be temporarily prohibited from
contributing to the community. <br /><br />If you do not wish to have Valve moderating your Steam
Discussions, you can opt-out via your your app settings in Steamworks
<a

    >(https://partner.steamgames.com/apps/community/Your_APPID)</a
>.<br /><br /><img

    alt="opt-out_moderation.PNG"
    title="opt-out_moderation.PNG"
/><br /><br />If you take action on a post, or decide that the report is not valid, please make sure
you resolve the report so other moderators and admins know the issue has been dealt with. When
viewing a reported post, there is a link in the right-hand column to "Mark as Resolved".
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Moderation Tools</h2>
These are the tools we use when resolving reported content throughout the community. Mousing over a
user post will reveal post-specific options, while the <i>Moderator Tools</i> panel on the right
side of the page contains broader options for thread management.
<h4>Editing Posts</h4>
You should rarely need to edit a post from a player. However, it may be useful to remove personal
information, or fix a broken link. Editing may be also be appropriate in cases where the post
contains valid points and deleting the post is not desirable (see deleting guidelines below).
<h4>Deleting Threads or Posts</h4>
Deleting content sends a powerful message to users and should be reserved for highly offensive
content or things like phishing attempts. It should only be done when something is clearly in
violation of the
<a
    href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4045-USHJ-3810"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >Steam Community Rules And Guidelines</a
>. Do not use the delete feature to hide negative reviews or criticisms of the game. Doing so will
quickly turn your forum into a place to discuss moderator actions, instead of the game itself. Users
have a right to express their discontent with a game or its features.<br /><br />If there are
multiple negative threads pertaining to the same issue, you are encouraged to merge them together.
<h4>Merging Threads</h4>
Merging threads is useful for combining a number of discussions with the same topic into one thread.
You may want to do this if there are a bunch of threads reporting the same bug or asking the same
question, as it allows you then to reply to all those users at once, or simply foster a
collaborative discussion among users that are having a similar experience. This tool is especially
helpful for keeping your discussions organized without censoring users.
<h4>Locking Threads</h4>
Locking threads should be treated with similar care as deleting. Users will continue to create new
threads if they feel that a thread was prematurely locked. However, if a thread has turned into a
non-constructive argument between users, or derailed entirely off topic, you should consider locking
it. It is often helpful to post in a thread prior to locking it, explaining why it was locked.
<h4>Marking a Thread as Answered</h4>
This option will sticky the selected post to the top of the thread with a blue highlight indicating
that you have marked that post as an answer to original poster's topic. It's is a great option if
you find a particularly helpful or relevant post within one of your Discussion threads that should
be officially surfaced. <br /><br />This option is also available to the thread's creator, provided
that the thread has not been locked. Developers can overwrite previously answered threads, but
unless the post is misleading or false, it's generally a good idea not to overwrite.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Warnings, Bans &amp; Messaging</h2>
If a user is posting or behaving in a manner that detrimental to your community, several options are
available to moderators. These are available via the dropdown menu next to the player name contained
in posts and threads.
<h4>Private Messages</h4>
PMs are the most basic tool for communicating with users in your Discussion hub. It is also a great
tool for users who may be doing something improperly, but you don't want the message to carry the
negative context of a ban or warning. An example would be a user posting a bug report outside of
your official bug report section.
<h4>Warning Users</h4>
Warnings are another great first step when you want to communicate directly to a user that their
behavior is against the rules. Several pre-written warning reasons can be selected when issuing one.
The pre-written messages are translated into whatever language the user has Steam set to. You also
have the ability to write a custom warning reason, but these of course will not support
translations. <br /><br />We feel that in most cases, giving users the benefit of the doubt and
issuing a warning is the correct first response to users breaking the

    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >Steam Community Rules And Guidelines</a
>.
<h4>Banning Users</h4>
Bans are a last resort for violations of the
<a
    href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4045-USHJ-3810"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >Steam Community Rules And Guidelines</a
>. They should be temporary in order to serve as a reminder of the discussion rules.<br /><br />If a
user has received previous temp bans, it may be appropriate to permanently ban them from your Hub.
If you do need to ban a user, please leave a clear, concise ban reason when doing so. This ban
reason is visible to the user as well as other moderators.
<h4>Effects of a Ban</h4>
While banned, an account will not be able to interact in your community hub. This includes creating
new threads and posting in existing ones.<br /><br />Banned accounts are also not allowed to upload
screenshots, artwork, guides, workshop items or other UGC types to your hub.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Moderating Screenshots, Videos, and Workshop Items</h2>
As an admin or moderator with proper permissions, you have a number of tools available for
moderation. For details on granting permissions to moderators or internal developers, please see
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/community_moderation/adding_moderators"
    class="bb_doclink"
    >Adding Community Moderators</a
>.
<h4>Hiding as Incompatible</h4>
Use this option to disassociate content from its respective Game Hub. This option is designed to
remove the content from the hub/game, without affecting the content or the upload privileges of the
owner. For example, if a Dota screenshot is uploaded to the CS:GO hub, hiding it as incompatible
would be the ideal moderation action (the user would still have their screenshot, but it would no
longer be associated with CS:GO). <br /><br />Users will not be notified of this action, unless it
is a Workshop item. In those cases, the notification makes the owner aware that their item will no
longer be associated with the hub, nor available in the game.
<h4>Hiding as Inappropriate</h4>
Use this option to hide the content for users who have asked not to be exposed to extreme violence
or sexual content. Hiding as inappropriate will blur the preview image for the content, preventing
users from seeing it w/o acknowledgment of an age-gate. <br /><br />When in doubt, use this option
instead of banning. Usually, this is content that is lewd (e.g. characters posed in inappropriate
positions), contains nudity, features extreme violence, or is otherwise generally inappropriate.
<h4>Banning Items</h4>
Banning content should be reserved for items that violate the Steam Subscriber Agreement, such as:
offensive content (e.g. racism), pornography (e.g. pornographic sprays/decals in Counter-Strike),
stolen Workshop items, etc. Users will receive an email that their item has been banned and that it
is only visible to them.
<h4>Clearing Reports</h4>
Clear reports on items that do not fall into the categories above. This will get the item off the
list once the search caches get refreshed.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="6"></a>Moderating Reviews</h2>
Users that have launched and played or used your product on Steam can write reviews and indicate
whether they recommend your product to others. These reviews may then appear on your product's store
page and in the Steam Community, depending on how many other users find that review helpful. You can
learn more by reading the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/reviews" class="bb_doclink">User Reviews</a>
documentation.
<h4>Flagging Reviews</h4>
There may be some cases where reviews contain inappropriate material, such as scams, harassment, or
are otherwise abusive. They are also occasionally reviews that are entirely off-topic and don't
relate to your product at all. For these two cases, we have provided tools for flagging reviews for
further review.<br /><br />Flagging should be reserved for clear-cut cases. When in doubt, just
allow the users to down vote the review and use the report tool. In most cases, reviews that are
off-topic won't be rated as helpful by customers and thus will not appear to many users.<br /><br />To
flag a review:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Click the "Recommended" or "Not Recommended" headline of a review to open up the detail view
        of that review.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        You will find a orange section in the right-hand column for "moderator controls" where you
        will see a drop-down for flagging the review.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Select "Abusive" if the review contains a scam, harassment, or is otherwise abusive to Steam
        users.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Select "Off-Topic" only if the review doesn't relate to your product or the service you are
        providing. An example is if the review talks about ice cream instead of your strategy
        game.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        With either choice, you will get a confirmation dialog. Then select "OK". Steam Community
        Moderators or Valve Employees will then review flagged reviews and delete or unflag as
        appropriate.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Responding to a review</h4>
There may be cases where the reviewer has incorrect information about your product, or may have
encountered a bug that has since been resolved. To help keep the community on-track, we have
provided tools for developers to respond directly to such reviews.<br /><br />This response will be
visible to anyone who can see the review and will be marked as an official response from the
developer.<br /><br />To reply directly to a review:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Click the "Recommended" or "Not Recommended" headline of a review to open up the detail view
        of that review.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        You will find a orange section in the right-hand column for "moderator controls" where you
        will see a link for "Write Official Developer Response."<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Once you click the link, you will be provided with a text field to enter your response.
        Please remember to keep it clear and concise. Similar recommendations apply here as in the
        Overview for moderating best practices above.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        This response will then appear immediately below the related review and will be visible to
        anyone that can see the review.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />Though it may be tempting, not every review needs to be responded to.
