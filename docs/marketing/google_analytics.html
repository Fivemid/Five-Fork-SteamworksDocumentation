<h1>Google Analytics</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
You can enable Google Analytics for your Steam Store page and/or Community Hub
for anonymized data about your traffic sources and visitor behavior.
<h2 class="bb_section">
  <a name="2"></a>Getting a Google Analytics Tracking ID
</h2>
To view traffic sources and behavior on your Steam pages, you will need a Google
Analytics account and a tracking ID from Google Analytics that you enter in to
the Steamworks configuration site for your application.<br /><br />You'll need
to start by creating an account in Google Analytics if you don't already have
one. Head on over to
<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
  >http://www.google.com/analytics/</a
>
and either sign in to an existing Google account or create a new one.<br /><br />Once
you have enabled Analytics, you will be directed to create a new account and
property, which is where you define a friendly name, URL and ultimately get the
tracking id necessary to enable this on Steam. Here is an example of what to
enter for your product:<br /><br /><img

  alt="analytics_newaccount.jpg"
  title="analytics_newaccount.jpg"
/><br /><br />You'll need to set the "Web Site URL" field above to be the URL of
the page you will be using the tracking code for.<br /><br />If you are tracking
your store page, you will need to use this URL format:
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">store.steampowered.com</code
><br />If you are tracking your community hub, you will need to use this URL
format:
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">www.steamcommunity.com</code
><br /><br />Once you have filled in all the necessary information and clicked
the "Get Tracking ID", you will be taken to a page that shows you your new
tracking ID. You will need to take that ID and enter it in to the appropriate
location as described below.<br /><br />For easily tracking your Store traffic
and Community Hub traffic, you'll want to create two unique tracking IDs.
Otherwise the URLs can get confusing when viewing the traffic in Google
Analytics.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Enabling For Your Store Page</h2>
Once you have a Tracking ID in hand as described above, you'll need to enter
that ID into your store configuration page in the Steamworks website for
whatever product you wish to track.<br /><br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
  <li>Go to your Steamworks home page<br /></li>
  <li>
    Search for or select the application you are interested in tracking<br />
  </li>
  <li>On the application landing page, click "Edit Store Page"<br /></li>
  <li>
    In the Store Page Admin, select the "Special Settings" tab and enter your
    code in the appropriate section there<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    Save and publish your store page (or wait until your store page is released)
  </li>
</ol>
<br />Once the store page is published, you will start seeing any traffic to
your page show up in the real-time data in Google Analytics.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Enabling For Your Community Hub</h2>
Once you have a Tracking ID in hand as described above, you'll need to enter
that ID into your community configuration page in the Steamworks website for
whatever product you wish to track.<br /><br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
  <li>Go to your Steamworks home page<br /></li>
  <li>
    Search for or select the application you are interested in tracking<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    On the application landing page, click "Edit Steamworks Settings"<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    In the App Data Admin, select "Community Hub" from the Community tab and
    enter your code in the appropriate section there<br />
  </li>
  <li>Save and switch to the Publish tab and publish your changes</li>
</ol>
Once the Steamworks Settings are finished publishing, you will start seeing any
traffic to your Community Hub show up in the real-time data in Google Analytics.
