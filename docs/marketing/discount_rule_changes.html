<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Policy Change Overview</h2>
Starting on March 28, 2022, the time between discounts run on Steam will change from six weeks to 4
weeks (28 days). This means a minimum of 28 days between the end of one discount and the start of
another discount.<br /><br />This discount cooldown period applies to all types of promotions and
discounts across Steam, with the only exceptions being our four major store-wide seasonal sales:
Lunar New Year Sale, Summer Sale, Autumn Sale, and Winter Sale.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<strong
    >Q. Will there still be sale events that accompany other physical and digital festivals?</strong
><br />A. Absolutely! If you have been invited to participate in a Steam sale event organized by
someone outside of Valve (eg. physical events such as PAX or Gamescom; regional events such as a
Made in France sale) you'll just need to consider whether that event works for the discount cooldown
timing on your game. It's also fine to participate in events like that without being on discount.<br /><br /><br /><strong
    >Q. Will these new discount cooldowns apply to curated promotions too?</strong
><br />A. Yes, discount cooldowns will apply to promotions like Daily Deals, Midweek Madness,
Weekend Deals, Weeklong deals, publisher weekends, and any custom discounts. Any discount applied to
a game must have 28 days between the end of one discount and the beginning of the next discount. The
only exceptions to this cooldown are the four major seasonal sales: Lunar New Year, Summer, Autumn,
Winter.<br /><br /><strong
    >Q. What about discounts that are just prior to and following the March 28th changeover?</strong
><br />A. For this transitionary period, the order in which the discounts are scheduled is
important. Steam checks the discount cooldown rules at the time the discount is being scheduled. So
if you were to schedule a discount during March, the next time you could schedule a discount for
that game would be 28 days following the end of that previous event.<br />However, if you first
scheduled a discount in April (following the rule change) and then tried to schedule one prior to
that, you would need to schedule the earlier one at least 6-weeks ahead.
