<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Policy Change Overview</h2>
Starting on January 1, 2023, the time between discounts run on Steam will change from 28 days to 30
days. This means a minimum of 30 days between the end of one discount and the start of another
discount.<br />
<br />
This discount cooldown period applies to all types of promotions and discounts across Steam, with
the only exceptions being our four major store-wide seasonal sales: Spring Sale, Summer Sale, Autumn
Sale, and Winter Sale.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<strong
    >Q. Will there still be sale events that accompany other physical and digital festivals?</strong
><br />
A. Absolutely! If you have been invited to participate in a Steam sale event organized by someone
outside of Valve (eg. physical events such as PAX or Gamescom; regional events such as a Made in
France sale) you'll just need to consider whether that event works for the discount cooldown timing
on your game. It's also fine to participate in events like that without being on discount.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. Will these new discount cooldowns apply to curated promotions too?</strong><br />
A. Yes, discount cooldowns will apply to promotions like Daily Deals, Midweek Madness, Weekend
Deals, Weeklong deals, publisher weekends, and any custom discounts. Any discount applied to a game
must have 30 days between the end of one discount and the beginning of the next discount. The only
exceptions to this cooldown are the four major seasonal sales: Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter.
