<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>How do you decide which coupon a user gets?</h2>
A coupon is selected at random for a user, excluding coupons for games they already own. Right now
it's an even distribution; but we'll be changing it select coupons that are more likely to be
redeemed, based on their current redemption rates.
<h2 class="bb_subsection">
    <a name="4"></a>How do we measure success? Coupon drop, trade, &amp; redemption rate?
</h2>
There is a 'Coupons' link at the top of the financial site that will show you all existing coupon
activity.
<h2 class="bb_subsection">
    <a name="5"></a>Can coupons be stacked with other coupons or discounts?
</h2>
No, the coupons cannot be stacked with other coupons, and coupons cannot be stacked with any
discount or sale price.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Can we add other discounts or frequency rates?</h2>
No, they are fixed in the system.

</h2>

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="8"></a>Can coupons be traded between users?</h2>
