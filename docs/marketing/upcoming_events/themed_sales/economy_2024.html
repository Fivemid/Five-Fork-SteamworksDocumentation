<strong>Steam Capitalism and Economy Fest</strong> focuses on games that are about cold hard cash.
Sure, these games might have KPIs that are not money, but really the focus is on that sweet sweet
money and that well-known economic structure called capitalism.<br />
<br />
This event runs January 8 at 10:00 AM PST (UTC-8) to January 15 at 10:00 AM PST (UTC-8) and will
include eligible titles with sections for discounted titles, unreleased titles in Coming Soon mode,
games with demos, and more.<br />

        <strong>January 4</strong> - The trailer announcing the event launches on this day. At this
        point, you're welcome to share your participation in the event. Assets for this purpose will
        be available in the <a href="#asset" class="bb_doclink">Asset Kit</a> below. <br />

    <li>
        <strong>January 8, 10am PST</strong> - The event starts. This is the deadline for entering a

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="eligibility"></a>Eligibility</h2>
Games must be launched or in Coming Soon mode to be eligible for these events. If your game is not
yet in Coming Soon, you can appeal to have your game join once you've released your Store Page. The
base game must be eligible for the event; DLCs alone are not eligible. Eligibility is determined by
the tags applied to your game's store page, as well as the gameplay that is evident from how you
describe and represent your game on your store page. <br />
<br />
Games that are about capitalism, economy, or money grubbing are allowed in this event. It doesn't
have to be real money—cookies count as a currency!—but the entire goal of the game should be to make
money. If your game is mostly about shooting, or is an action-adventure game where you can buy
things with your money, or is a city builder where you have to survive zombies/the heat death of the
universe/dinosaurs, unfortunately this is not the event for that title.<br />
<br />
Do you game-over if you run out of money? If the answer is yes, then your title is likely a good
fit. If the answer is no, but the player can take out loans to try and extend that runway, then the
answer is almost definitely yes. If you can game-over while you have money, then it's it's probably
not a good fit for this event.<br />
<br />
Games that are mostly about trading or bartering are not eligible for this event. Sorry, this is an
event for Capitalist titles only!<br />
<br />
Games likely to be eligible will (at minimum) include one or more of these tags: <br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Capitalism<br /></li>
    <li>Economy</li>
</ul>
<br />
Games likely to be eligible typically feature mechanics and/or elements including:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        The primary goal of the game must be to make money (either real currency or in-game fantasy
        currency)<br />
    </li>
    <li>The money acquired should be spent to make even more money</li>
</ul>
<br />
Examples of games that may not include making money (as described above) as the primary game
mechanic and thus may not be eligible include:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>If you can game-over when you have money (ie survival city builders)<br /></li>
    <li>Games that are primarily platformers, puzzles, shooters, or 'action-y' genres<br /></li>
    <li>Games focused on trading<br /></li>
    <li>Games where survival is the primary component</li>
</ul>
