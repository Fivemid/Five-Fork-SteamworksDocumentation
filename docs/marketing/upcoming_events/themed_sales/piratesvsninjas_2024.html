<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="eligibility"></a>Eligibility</h2>
Games must be launched or in Coming Soon mode to be eligible for these events. If your game is not
yet in Coming Soon, you can appeal to have your game join once you've released your Store Page. The
base game must be eligible for the event; DLCs alone are not eligible. Eligibility is determined by
the tags applied to your game's store page, as well as the gameplay that is evident from how you
describe and represent your game on your store page. <br />
<br />
All the games in this Fest must majorly feature either a pirate or a ninja. If you've got both, even
better! And just so you know, we aren't the pirate or ninja policeâ€”if your title features sparkle
ninjas in pink and space pirates, that's totally fine, but those characters should still be
identifiable as a ninja or pirate. Your ninja character should probably be stealthy, agile, use
throwing weapons or swords, and maybe even wear tabi. Your pirate better be near the sea (or
something sea-adjacent, if your title is set in space or somewhere else without oceans), with an
eyepatch or a parrot, and have an unhealthy obsession with gold and plunder.<br />
<br />
If your game has a bunch of people in it, then your pirate and/or ninja must be front and center! If
you're a game that takes place by the ocean, and you occasionally run into pirates: sorry, this is
not the event for you. If "naval" is a better descriptor than "pirate" for your game, then that's
also not good for this event. A treasure hunter is not a pirate, unless he's on a ship with a crew
that may or may not be running from the authorities because they stole a lot of something in the
last port. If a five-year-old would recognize your character as a pirate or a ninja, then this is
the event for you!<br />
<br />
Games likely to be eligible will (at minimum) include one or more of these tags: <br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Pirates<br /></li>
    <li>Ninja</li>
</ul>
<br />
Games likely to be eligible typically feature mechanics and/or elements including:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        The primary character(s) must be either a pirate or a ninja, and the environment must be
        comfortable for either<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If the primary character can be described as a "buccaneer," "swashbuckler," or similar,
        there's no requirement that someone has to be explicitly labeled as "pirate"<br />
    </li>
    <li>Hunting pirates and/or ninjas are not eligible, unless it is the primary gameplay</li>
</ul>
<br />
Examples of games that may not feature gameplay with pirates or ninjas (as described above) as the
primary game mechanic and thus may not be eligible include:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Games that take place on islands with ships - pirates must be involved<br /></li>
    <li>
        Match-3, platformer, and puzzles where the main character is a pirate and/or ninja, but the
        environment is mostly not-pirate or ninja themed
    </li>
</ul>
