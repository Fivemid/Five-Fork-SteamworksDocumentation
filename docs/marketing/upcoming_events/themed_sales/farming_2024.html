<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="eligibility"></a>Eligibility</h2>
Games must be launched or in Coming Soon mode to be eligible for these events. If your game is not
yet in Coming Soon, you can appeal to have your game join once you've released your Store Page. The
base game must be eligible for the event; DLCs alone are not eligible. Eligibility is determined by
the tags applied to your game's store page, as well as the gameplay that is evident from how you
describe and represent your game on your store page. <br />
<br />
If your game is primarily about farming, making the character farm, or making minions to farm for
you, then it is eligible for this event. <br />
<br />
Does your character only farm part of the time? You might still be eligible, as long as farming is a
core part of your gameplay and not just a side thing or mini-game.<br />
<br />
Now, we're not picky about what you're farming—it could be turnips, rice, star shards, fish, or
magic potions—but you do have to be growing something. You have to be able to harvest those things
for money or gameplay progression to be eligible for this event. You should probably also have some
tilled earth at some point, a few seed/sprout/crop images, and maybe a watering can?<br />
<br />
Games likely to be eligible will (at minimum) include one or more of these tags: <br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Farming<br /></li>
    <li>Farming Sim<br /></li>
    <li>Agriculture</li>
</ul>
<br />
Games likely to be eligible typically feature mechanics and/or elements including:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        You must be able to grow something (fish, vegetables, fruit) that can be harvested for money
        or gameplay progression<br />
    </li>
    <li>Games where the primary game loop does not involve the above are not eligible</li>
</ul>
<br />
Examples of games that may not include farming (as described above) as the primary game mechanic and
thus may not be eligible include:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Games with farming DLC<br /></li>
    <li>Games where the primary gameplay is economic<br /></li>
    <li>Games where the farm is a backdrop</li>
</ul>
