<br />
<strong>Steam Deckbuilders Fest</strong> celebrates card games where you can build and manage your
deck of cards. It doesn't necessarily have to be represented with cards, but the mechanic should be
easily understood as a deckbuilding kind of game. Those cards can be your typical
attack/defense/special effect cards, but they can also represent resources, characters, or other
non-combat related things.<br />
<br />
This event runs March 25 at 10:00 AM PDT (UTC-7) to April 1 at 10:00 AM PDT (UTC-7) and will include
eligible titles with sections for discounted titles, unreleased titles in Coming Soon mode, games
with demos, and more.<br />

    <li>
        <strong>March 21</strong> - The trailer announcing the event launches on this day. At this
        point, you're welcome to share your participation in the event. When the asset kit is ready,
        it will be available below. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>March 25, 10am PDT</strong> - The event starts. This is the deadline for entering a
        discount, and opting out if you no longer want to participate.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="eligibility"></a>Eligibility</h2>
Games must be launched or in Coming Soon mode to be eligible for these events. If your game is not
yet in Coming Soon, you can appeal to have your game join once you've released your Store Page. The
base game must be eligible for the event; DLCs alone are not eligible.<br />
<br />
To be eligible for this Fest, your Deckbuilding game must include the ability to both add and remove
cards. The way you add/remove cards is up to you—random chance, after every boss fight, what have
you—but you must be able to modify your deck of cards by progressing through the game.<br />
<br />
Now, your game can have other elements in it that aren't just gaining/playing/destroying cards, but
the deckbuilding portion better be a significant part of the game. In fact, if it's not called out
in the store page in some way, it's probably not a good fit! A good minigame is always fun, but we
want the deckbuilding to be a big part of it.<br />
<br />
Another word on eligibility: while most TCG will be a good fit for this event, not all board games
qualify. If you do manage your cards in the game, great! But if you just draw them, and have no way
of managing them and can only play them in a specific order, this is not the event for you.<br />
<br />
Games likely to be eligible will (at minimum) include one or more of these tags: <br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Deckbuilding<br /></li>
    <li>Roguelike Deckbuilder</li>
</ul>
<br />
Games likely to be eligible typically feature mechanics and/or elements including:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>The game must involve acquiring and managing a deck of cards<br /></li>
    <li>
        The management of the deck does not necessarily have to be direct, games where you can
        influence the deck via events (eg Slay the Spire) are eligible<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        It doesn't necessarily have to be cards, but if it could not be communicated with cards,
        then it's probably not a good fit
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
Examples of games that may not include deckbuilding (as described above) as the primary game
mechanic and thus may not be eligible include:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Games that feature 'cards' in deciding upgrades, and have no way of managing said cards</li>
</ul>
