<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="eligibility"></a>Eligibility</h2>
Games must be launched or in Coming Soon mode to be eligible for these events. If your game is not
yet in Coming Soon, you can appeal to have your game join once you've released your Store Page. The
base game must be eligible for the event; DLCs alone are not eligible. Eligibility is determined by
the tags applied to your game's store page, as well as the gameplay that is evident from how you
describe and represent your game on your store page. <br />
<br />
Any game that supports the Remote Play Together feature, and has enabled the "Remote Play Together"
feature on the game's store page, is eligible to participate.<br />
<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="RPT"></a>Adding Remote Play Together Feature Support</h2>
If your title has local multiplayer support, it may be a good candidate for the Remote Play Together
feature. The feature enables a player to invite a friend to join their game session via Remote Play
streaming, even when their friend doesnâ€™t own the game, or even have a Steam account, as though they
invited their friend over to their house. Remote Play Together can be a great way to introduce new
players to your title.<br />
<br />
The feature is enabled automatically for games that are indicated to have Local Multiplayer, Local
Co-op, or Shared/Split Screen capability, but you can enable or disable it yourself to match whether
this feature is appropriate for your game.<br />
<br />
To enable the feature, edit your title's settings in the Steamworks Store Page Admin. On the Basic
Info tab, under Supported Features, check Remote Play Together.<br />
<br />
