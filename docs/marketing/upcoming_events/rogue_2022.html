<h1>Going Rogue: A Festival of Persistence - 2022</h1>
<strong>Going Rogue: A Festival of Persistence</strong> is a celebration of games from a few loosely
related genres: Roguelike, Roguelite, Souls-like, and Metroidvania. These games usually involve
repeating parts of a game over and over until you master the section or gain enough experience to
continue forward.<br /><br />This event will include discounting, as well as sections for unreleased
games, and games with demos.<br /><br />This event runs May 2 at 10am Pacific through May 9 at 10am
Pacific.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Eligibility</h2>
This event is targeted toward games that are primarily thought of as one of these types of games:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Roguelike<br /></li>
    <li>Roguelite<br /></li>
    <li>Souls-like<br /></li>
    <li>Metroidvania</li>
</ul>
<br />These games generally share mechanics of repeating parts of the game again and again, or
re-treading ground once the player has gained enough experience or equipment.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Invitation Process</h2>
We'll be inviting specific games to participate in Going Rogue based on the criteria above. This
invitation will go out to the Steamworks users that have "Receive Steamworks Communication"
permission for eligible games.<br /><br />The invitation will ask you to register that game for
Going Rogue, which is as easy as clicking one checkbox and saving. That registration will tell us
which games intend to participate.<br /><br />Once registered, users in your account with "Edit
Pricing Permissions" will then see the Going Rogue Sale appear in the new discounting approval tools
and you can enter discounts for your game.<br /><br />If you have not received an email invitation
