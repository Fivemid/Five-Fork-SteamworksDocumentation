<h1>Simfest 2022: Hobby Edition</h1>
<strong>Steam Simfest: Hobby Edition</strong> is a celebration of games that attempt to simulate a
hobby or job. There are now hundreds of titles on Steam that do just this, and we're excited to
feature them in our first Simfest this spring.<br /><br />This event will feature 12 hours of
original livestream programming, including talks and panels. Plus, developers can run their own
livestreams and of course discount their games to get the most out of shining a light on this genre
of games.<br /><br />This even runs March 28 at 10am Pacific - April 4th at 10am Pacific.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Eligibility</h2>
The "Hobby Sim" subgenre is not yet well-defined within Steam, but this facet of Simulation gaming
has become a big trend in recent months. As such, we have a set of criteria that we're using to
define the parameters of this event, and inviting eligible games to participate.<br /><br />A Hobby
Sim title is one that attempts to simulate a hobby or job, where it's fun to try your hand at
becoming an expert in the tasks at hand. To identify these titles, we've sought out those games
which feature<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>A first-person view of that hobby or job.<br /></li>
    <li>
        A specific and intense gameplay focus on the accurate replication of the actions of that
        hobby or job.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Digital reproduction of the equipment/machinery/objects used in that hobby or job.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Gameplay elements such as narrative and progression which are deployed in a manner to
        enhance the replication of the hobby/job.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Gameplay pacing which is generally set at a slower rate, consummate with the replication of
        the hobby/job.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        A game setting which is less about the imaginary/fantastical and more about a non-fictional
        activity. Where the job or hobby itself is fictional, the game is fastidious and authentic
        in portraying that hobby or job as though it were non-fiction.
    </li>
</ol>
<br />Most titles that are invited to participate include all six of the above characteristics,
though some may include just a majority of them, as they also fall within the spirit of the
event.<br /><br />For example, a simulation game like Dyson Sphere Program is amazing, but it's more
of a base-building sci fi sim, as opposed to a digital recreation of a real-life job or task. This
sale is targeted at the latter; games like Model Builder, PC Building Simulator, or PowerWash
Simulator.<br /><br />This event is also generally avoiding sports games, as we'll cover those
titles in a separate event later in the year.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Invitation Process</h2>
We'll be inviting specific games to participate in Simfest: Hobby Edition based on the criteria
above. This invitation will go out to the Steamworks users that have "Receive Steamworks
Communication" permission for eligible games.<br /><br />The invitation will ask you to register
that game for Simfest, which is as easy as clicking one checkbox and saving. That registration will
tell us which games intend to participate, and will unlock the ability for you to start scheduling
your livestream sessions if you so wish.<br /><br />Once registered, users in your account with
"Edit Pricing Permissions" will then see Sim Fest appear in the new discounting approval tools and
you can enter discounts for your game.<br /><br />If you have not received an email invitation by
March 9th and believe that you have a game that fits the criteria described above, please check

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Livestreams</h2>
Livestreaming will also be a component of the Simfest event, with dedicated visibility given to
games that are livestreaming. Here is how livestreaming will work for this event:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Once you have registered for Simfest, you can schedule up to two special Simfest Live Stream
        events between March 28th at 10am Pacific and April 1st at 10am Pacific. You'll find the new
        event type when creating a new Steam Announcement<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        These scheduled hour-long spots start on the top of each hour and will give your livestream
        a one-hour spot of higher visibility. When scheduling, please schedule your spot to begin on
        the hour (eg. "11:00", not "11:30") so you can get the most out of that spot.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        From April 1st at 10am Pacific through the remainder of the event, we'll be hosting our own
        official livestream as the default livestream that visitors see. There are no scheduled
        spots available during this time for individual games, though you may continue livestreaming
        if you wish.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />You may chose to run a livestream during parts of Simfest to show players what it's like to
play your game.

This is an official Steam Themed Sale and will be promoted significantly on the homepage of Steam
