<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="livestream"></a>Livestreaming Events (optional)</h2>
During the Fest, you have the opportunity to livestream your game so that potential players can see
what it's like to play your game and interact with the developers behind it.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="1"></a>Setting your own events to appear on our schedule</h2>
<br /><strong>You can create up to two special Tabletop Fest Livestream events</strong> among the
schedule of broadcasts featured in the Fest. While all active livestreams will always be available
at any time for players to browse, during your scheduled time your livestream will be featured more
prominently on this schedule. <br /><br />For more information, please see:<br />

</ul>
<br /><strong>Be sure to select the<i> Steam Tabletop Fest Special Events</i></strong> type in order
to appear on the Event Schedule.
<strong>You can only create two of these special events per app, even if you delete one</strong> so
if you are testing your livestream setup, you should be sure to test by scheduling a regular
livestream event type.<br /><br /><strong>NOTE:</strong
><strong> If you collaborated with Auroch Digital to create a broadcast event</strong>, it is
already featured on our schedule of Tabletop Fest events. To make your players and fans aware of
these offical events, post an event of your own and link to the official event listed in the
schedule.
<strong>Your reposted event <i>should not be set up as a Tabletop Fest Special event</i></strong> as
indicated below, as this will just cause redundancy in the schedule. For more info, see the next
section, <i>Scheduling Reference Events</i>.<br /><br /><img
