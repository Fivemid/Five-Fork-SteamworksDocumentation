<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="eligibility"></a>Eligibility</h2>
This event is targeted toward games and in-game events primarily designed around spooky and festive
themes. Appropriate games and in-game events would be centered around these themes vs. merely
including one character or cosmetic. <br /><br /><strong>For games, relevant tags include:</strong
><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Horror <br /></li>
    <li>Survival Horror <br /></li>
    <li>Vampires <br /></li>
    <li>Werewolves<br /></li>
    <li>Supernatural<br /></li>
    <li>Dark Fantasy<br /></li>
    <li>Lovecraftian</li>
</ul>
<br /><strong
    >For in-game events, criteria specific to inclusion in Steam Scream Fest include:</strong
><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Elements—e.g. dedicated items / cosmetics, thematic quests, maps, characters, and/or
        action—must occur in-game. A purely cosmetic or superficial reskinning of assets like the
        menu is not sufficient. <br />
    </li>
    <li>Description of in-game event must be clear and easily determinable. <br /></li>
    <li>
        In-game event must run <i>at least</i> during the dates of Steam ScreamFest: October 25 at
        10:00 AM PDT (UTC-7) to November 1 at 10:00 AM PDT (UTC-7)
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="invitation"></a>Invitation Process</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Halloween-Themed Games</h2>
We'll be inviting specific games to participate in Steam Scream Fest based on the criteria above.
This invitation will go out to Steamworks users who have set "Receive Steamworks Communication"
permission for eligible games. Reference
<a href="#faq" class="bb_doclink">Frequently Asked Questions</a> to ensure your communication
preferences are set to permit these communications, or for details on how to access key information
if opted out. <br /><br />The invitation will ask you to register that game for Steam Scream Fest,
which is as easy as clicking one checkbox and saving. That registration will tell us which games
intend to participate.<br /><br />Once registered, users in your account with "Edit Pricing
Permissions" will then see the Steam Scream Fest event appear in the discounting approval tools and
can enter discounts for your released, eligible game there.<br /><br />If you have not received an
email invitation and believe that you have a game that fits the criteria described above, please
check
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/optin/sale/halloween_2022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Halloween-Themed In-Game Events</h2>
If you are adding new maps, items, artwork, or other content to your game for Halloween or running
limited-time events with special themed content, challenges, or other similar activities—and
otherwise meet the eligibility criteria described above—please let us know by selecting "Halloween
Event" using the Steam Events system when creating a new event or announcement (available beginning

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="participate"></a>Ways To Participate</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Discounts</h2>
A discount is not required to participate in Steam Scream Fest, though the event page will most
prominently feature discounted games. All invited titles can participate with a discount unless your
game is not yet released, releases within 28 days of the start of the fest, or already has another
discount scheduled too soon prior or following Steam Scream Fest.<br /><br /><strong
    >Reminder: As of March 28, 2022, all sales and discount opportunities are subject to the same
    28-day cooldown between discounts.</strong

The only exceptions are the four major Steam seasonal sales. For more details on the discounting
rule changes, please see

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Demos</h2>
If you've got an upcoming game that fits the criteria above (or even if you have a released game)
you may release a demo to include in the event. We'll have a section for games with free demos, as
well as lists of upcoming releases. Just make sure your demo is fully released before the start of
the fest to ensure that your game is listed as having a demo available.<br /><br />See
