        point, you're welcome to share your participation in the event. Assets for this purpose will

</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="eligibility"></a>Eligibility</h2>
Games must be launched or in Coming Soon mode to be eligible for this event. If your game is not yet
in Coming Soon, you can appeal to have your game join once you've released your Store Page. The base
game must be eligible for the event; DLCs alone are not eligible.<br />
<br />
This event is targeted toward games primarily designed around spooky and festive themes. Appropriate
games would be centered around these themes vs. merely including one character or cosmetic. <br />
<br />
<strong>Relevant tags include:</strong><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Horror <br /></li>
    <li>Survival Horror <br /></li>
    <li>Vampires<br /></li>
    <li>Zombies <br /></li>
    <li>Werewolves<br /></li>

    <li>Dark Fantasy<br /></li>
    <li>Lovecraftian</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>In-Game Events</h2>
Steam will not be surfacing spooky in-game events as part of Steam Scream: The Revenge. We’ve
received a significant amount of feedback from past Halloween sales that, due to the way in-game
events (with wildly varying degrees of spookiness) are surfaced on the sale page, we can offer a
better developer and player experience by focusing exclusively on inherently spooky games
themselves.<br />
<br />
So, to make it easier for developers and Steam users to connect over the scary games Steam Scream is
intended to celebrate, Steam will only be surfacing spooky games during the sale, and not in-game
spooky events. That being said, you’re still more than welcome to do spooky in-game events and
market them to your audience however you see fit.
