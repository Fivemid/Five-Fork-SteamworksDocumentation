<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
Steam Next Fest returns February 6th to February 13th, 2023! Steam Next Fest is a multi-day
celebration where fans can try out demos, chat with developers, watch livestreams, and learn about
upcoming games on Steam. For developers, Steam Next Fest is an opportunity to get early feedback
from players and build an audience for a future launch on Steam.<br />
<br />
During this time, games will be organized on the landing page based on the categories you select
when registering as well the tags that are applied to your base game's store page. See
<a href="#visibility" class="bb_doclink">Visibility of Games</a> below for more details.<br />
<br />
Steam Next Fest displays live broadcasts from games based on a schedule that allows you to select up
to two times for your game's livestream to be promoted more prominently. See
<a href="#livestream" class="bb_doclink">Livestreaming Events</a> below for more details.<br />

access to preview how your demo will appear in the event, official marketing materials opt-in for
trailer and/or livestream inclusion, etc.—takes place primarily through email. Reference

    </li>
    <li>
        A game may only appear once in Steam Next Fest. Choose the Steam Next Fest that works best

        Release your demo. You can release your demo at any time once it has been reviewed and

        festival begins.<br />

            <li>

        If you plan on livestreaming, test that you can do a livestream of your game and schedule up
        to two Steam Next Fest Livestream events to appear in the official schedule (scheduling tool
        will be available once registration has closed). Here are the steps for streaming a demo on
        Steam:

<h2 class="bb_subsection">
    <a name="7"></a>During the Festival (starts at 10am PST on February 6th)
</h2>
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Release your demo if you haven't already<br /></li>
    <li>
        Promote your participation on social media and encourage fans to give your demo a try (see
        the <a href="#asset" class="bb_doclink">asset kit</a> below for some graphics you can
        use)<br />
    </li>
    <li>Check your Community Hub and other social channels for feedback on your demo<br /></li>
    <li>Run your livestream(s) if you had planned one or two</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="demo"></a>Preparing your demo (required)</h2>
Steam Next Fest is built around the concept of giving players a chance to get hands-on with a
playable demo of your game. On Steam, that means setting up a specific demo type app, which is
attached to your full game on Steam. To learn about creating, testing, and releasing a demo, please
see
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/demos" class="bb_doclink"
    >Demos Documentation</a
>.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="livestream"></a>Running a livestream (optional)</h2>
During the festival, you have the opportunity to livestream your game so potential players can see
what it's like to play your game and can interact with the developers behind the game.<br />
<br />
<strong>You can create up to two special Steam Next Fest Livestream events</strong> to have your
game listed in the livestreaming schedule and have Steam promote your livestream to players. While
all active livestreams will always be available at any time for players to browse, during your
scheduled time your livestream will be featured more prominently. <br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="trailer"></a>Trailer and Demo Gameplay Usage</h2>
For the promotion of Steam Next Fest, our curation team selects 20-30 games to feature in our
official livestream and one or more video trailers that we share with press, post to social media,
and feature on the homepage of Steam.<br />
<br />
<strong>In order to remain in consideration for inclusion, you must:</strong><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Participate with your demo in this edition of Steam Next Fest. <br /></li>
    <li>Have selected the option during initial registration to give us permission.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Have received an additional opt-in request from Valve (mid-November) specifically indicating
        that your game is in consideration for inclusion in official marketing materials and have
        completed this opt-in.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Have at least one publicly visible trailer on your store page. <br /></li>
    <li>
        Have a playable build of your demo submitted for review and approved by
        <strong>December 31st.</strong> This deadline is firm. You may continue to update your demo
        at any time and may publicly release your demo any time you choose prior to the festival
        start.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
If you authorize trailer use and we use your game's trailer, we'll make use of one that is publicly
visible on your store page as of December 31st. If you authorize gameplay use, we may grant our Next
Fest event team access to the demo using Release Override Steam keys anytime after December 31st up
until the event starts, and the team will decide whether to use the demo gameplay.
<h2 class="bb_section">
    <a name="presspreview"></a>Press Preview Event Details (Starts January 26th)
</h2>
We’ll be offering select press outlets the opportunity to explore the full list of games registered
for Steam Next Fest starting 10 days ahead (Thursday, January 26th at 10am PST) of the main event.
The press preview page will give these outlets a chance to explore participating games and browse by
genre, theme, style, etc. and learn about your game(s) through the store page(s) you already have
up. This will allow press outlets to see what's coming up, play any of the demos that are already
available, and reach out if they’d like to learn more about your game(s) ahead of the festival.
<br />
<br />
Here are a couple of things to know about the press event:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        The press preview will include all games registered for Steam Next Fest. If you intend to
        withdraw from the event, please cancel your registration prior to the Press Preview.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Press will be free to cover the included games at any time, in any format (writeup, video,
        etc.). Some may want to give players a preview of games they're excited about ahead of
        time.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If you'd like your demo to be accessible by the press during this event, please simply
        prepare and release your demo on or ahead of the press preview event start. Make sure you
        plan for 3-5 days for your demo build to be reviewed ahead of release. Please note that
        releasing your demo will make it playable for everyone on Steam, not just press.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If you provided press contact information for your game on the Steam Next Fest registration
        form, we'll share that information with press in case they wish to get in contact with you.
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        This Press Preview will be conducted with a set of press outlets that we are specifically
        contacting for this purpose.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="visibility"></a>Visibility of Games</h2>
Games are organized within the Steam Next Fest page based on the categories you select when you
register and based on the tags you have applied to your base game's store page.<br />
<br />
A developer preview page will be available before the start of the event so you can see how the
festival will be organized and where your game is positioned within the festival. If you have issues
with your game showing up on the Steam Next Fest page, there are a few things you can check to
determine the cause:<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        Ensure that your base game is properly registered for the festival and that you've selected
        one or two categories for your game on the registration form. You can also visit your game's
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/optin/sale/nextfest_feb_2023/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >Steam Next Fest registration page</a
        >
        to see a list of the categories and sections that your game is listed in.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Make sure you have released your game demo before the start of the festival at 10am PST.
        Only games with released demos will be eligible to appear on the festival pages.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Make sure the store tags applied to your base game are accurate and complete. You may want
        to compare your
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/tags" class="bb_doclink"
            >store page tags</a
        >
        with the categories and sub-categories listed within the Steam Next Fest developer preview
        page and make any changes to your tags if necessary. For example, if you believe your game
        should be appearing in "Point-and-click adventure" games section, make sure that you've
        selected the "Adventure" category on the registration form and make sure your base game has
        the tag "Point-and-click" applied to it.
    </li>
</ol>

Here you will be able to download a kit of images and templates to use in your own social media
channels when telling your fans about your participation in Steam Next Fest. These images are

<br />
<br />
<strong>Q: Are Early Access games eligible to participate in Steam Next Fest?</strong><br />
A: Only games that have not released a playable build yet are eligible. If your game is already
released and available in Steam Early Access by the start of the festival, then your game is not
eligible to participate in Steam Next Fest.<br />
<br />
<strong
    >Q: Are games that have had or currently have a Playtest available eligible to participate in
    Steam Next Fest?</strong
><br />
A: Playtest does not affect eligibility. However, we do not recommend having a Playtest live during
Steam Next Fest, as this splits your players between the two opportunities versus concentrating them
around Steam Next Fest during the limited window the event runs.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. Are free games eligible to participate in Steam Next Fest?</strong><br />
A. Steam Next Fest is built around the concept of displaying demos that are associated with a full
game. So, if you're making a game that you intend to be free in the future, you can still
participate by creating and releasing a
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/demos" class="bb_doclink">demo</a>. As
with any game, you would still register your base full game for Steam Next Fest.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. What if I end up releasing my game before or during Steam Next Fest?</strong><br />
A. Only unreleased games are eligible to participate in Steam Next Fest. If you release your game
prior to or during Steam Next Fest, your game will become ineligible and will not be included in the
festival pages.<br />
<br />
<strong
    >Q. Can I submit a different version or edition of my game that already participated in a
    previous edition of Steam Next Fest?</strong
><br />
A. You may not submit a different version or edition of a title that has previously participated in
Steam Next Fest.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. Can I submit a re-release of an existing Steam game?</strong><br />
A. Steam Next Fest is intended for new games that have never been playable on Steam before. If you
are releasing a new edition of an existing game, then your game is not eligible for Steam Next
Fest.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q: Do I need to have my game and store page reviewed in order to register?</strong><br />
A: Yes, your base game's store page must be publicly visible in order to complete registration.
Additionally, the Valve curation team looks at each store page, including any screenshots, trailers,
and description to determine which games we will be highlighting during the festival.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q: Why isn't my game listed as eligible to be registered?</strong><br />
A: Some common issues that may prevent you from registering are:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Ensure that the store page for your game is set visible as 'coming soon'<br /></li>
    <li>
        If you are a member of multiple Steamworks partners, make sure you have the correct partner
        selected at the top of the Steamworks website.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong>Q. How will my game be categorized within the Steam Next Fest pages?</strong><br />
A. When you register your game for Steam Next Fest, you will be asked to choose the one or two
primary categories that best fit your game. These categories determine in which tabs your game can
appear within the fest. Then, within each tab, the fest is broken down into sub-genres. Your game
can appear in one or more of these sub-genres based on the store tags applied to your base game. For
more information on tags, please see
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/tags" class="bb_doclink">Store Tags</a>
documentation.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. How do I schedule a livestream to show up in Steam Next Fest?</strong><br />
A. The scheduling tool will become available not long after registration closes; its availability
will be communicated via email. Once available, you will be able to create up to two special Steam
Next Fest Livestream events within the Steam Events &amp; Announcements tool—the same place you go
to post announcements and schedule other forms of events for your game.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. How do I set up a livestream for my VR game?</strong><br />
A. Because of the way the SteamVR.exe service interacts with broadcasting, you'll need to use an
external tool (such as OBS). That will give you the necessary control to configure your broadcast
and let you point Steam directly at your game appID rather than SteamVR.exe. For more details,
please see
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/broadcast/setting_up" class="bb_doclink"
    >Setting Up A Stream</a
><br />
<br />
<strong>Q. Do I need to release my demo for the Press Preview?</strong><br />
A. No, you can wait and release your demo on February 6th if you wish. Releasing on or before
January 26th will allow your demo to be playable for press participating in the Press Preview, but
isn't necessary. Your game will still be listed on the Press Preview page either way.<br />
<br />
<strong
    >Q. Won't I miss some launch excitement if I release my demo early for the Press
    Preview?</strong

A. Demos don't have the same level of launch visibility as a full game, so it shouldn't be very
disruptive to release a demo ahead of Steam Next Fest. But, we also can't guarantee whether any
press will or will not play your demo. It's up to you and whether you feel you are ready.<br />
<br />
<strong>Q. How can I ensure I receive the relevant communications about Steam Next Fest?</strong
><br />
<br />
<strong>In Steamworks:</strong><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        If you are a member of multiple Steamworks partners, make sure you have the correct partner
        selected at the top of the Steamworks website.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure you have at least one account with "Receive Steamworks communications" enabled. You
        can edit per user here:
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/pub/users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >https://partner.steamgames.com/pub/users/</a
        >
        Note that accounts with this permission setting must also have completed or must newly
        complete the additional confirmation request sent via email authentication in order to fully
        enable permission.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong>In the Steam Store:</strong><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Have relevant users verify their personal email opt-in/out settings and ensure "New
        Steamworks features are announced or sales events are available" is selected here:
        <a
            href="https://store.steampowered.com/account/emailoptout"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >https://store.steampowered.com/account/emailoptout</a
        >
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
If you prefer to remain opted out of all communications, you may still participate in Steam Next
Fest. However, the only indication of your eligibility for both the event overall and for the
official marketing materials opt-in (if your game has been selected for potential inclusion in our
official marketing materials as described above) will be via the options below. Make sure to insert
your appID at the end of each URL.<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Access the registration page for your game:
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/optin/sale/nextfest_feb_2023/&lt;appid&gt;"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >https://partner.steamgames.com/optin/sale/nextfest_feb_2023/&lt;appid&gt;</a
        >
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Check for the opt-in(s) on your base game's App Admin page (in the Marketing Tools &amp;
        Data section):
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/apps/landing/&lt;appID&gt;"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >https://partner.steamgames.com/apps/landing/&lt;appID&gt;</a
        >
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong>Q. I've changed my plans. How do I cancel my registration?</strong><br />
A. Just return to the registration page for your game by inserting your appID at the end of this URL
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/optin/sale/nextfest_feb_2023/&lt;appid&gt;"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >https://partner.steamgames.com/optin/sale/nextfest_feb_2023/&lt;appid&gt;</a
>
and deselect the checkbox at the very bottom of the page to remove your game from the festival.
After opting out, if you have not released your game prior to a future Steam Next Fest, you could
participate in that one assuming the rest of the eligibility requirements are met.
