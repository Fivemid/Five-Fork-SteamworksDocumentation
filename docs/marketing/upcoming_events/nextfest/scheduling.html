<h1>Scheduling Next Fest Live Stream Events</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="livestream"></a>Livestreaming Events (optional)</h2>
During Steam Next Fest, you have the opportunity to livestream your game so that potential players
can see what it's like to play your game and to interact with the developers behind the game.<br /><br /><strong
    >IMPORTANT:</strong
>
Make sure you read our
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/broadcast/demo" class="bb_doclink"
    >livestreaming a demo documentation</a
>
for details on how to set up a livestream of your game demo.<br /><br /><strong
    >You can create up to two special Next Fest Livestream events</strong
>
to have your game listed in the livestreaming schedule and for Steam to promote your livestream to
players. While all active livestreams will always be available at any time for players to browse,
during your scheduled time your livestream will be featured more prominently. <br /><br />For more

<br />Be sure to select <i> Steam Next Fest: Live Stream</i> in order to appear on the Event
Schedule.
<strong>You can only create two of these special events per app, even if you delete one</strong> so
if you are testing your livestream setup, you should test by scheduling a regular livestream event
type first.<br /><br /><br /><img
