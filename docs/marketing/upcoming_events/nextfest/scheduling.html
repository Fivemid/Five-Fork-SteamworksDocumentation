<h1>Scheduling Steam Next Fest Live Stream Events</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="livestream"></a>Livestreaming Events (optional)</h2>
During Steam Next Fest, you have the opportunity to livestream your game so that potential players
can see what it's like to play your game and to interact with the developers behind the game.<br />
<br />
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Make sure you read our
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/broadcast/demo" class="bb_doclink"
    >livestreaming a demo documentation</a
>
for details on how to set up a livestream of your game demo.<br />
<br />
<strong>You can create up to two special Next Fest Livestream events</strong> to have your game
listed in the livestreaming schedule and for Steam to promote your livestream to players. While all
active livestreams will always be available at any time for players to browse, during your scheduled
time your livestream will be featured more prominently.
<strong>Be sure to start your livestream event on the hour (e.g., at 2:00 and not 2:30).</strong>
Failing to start your livestream on the hour may cause schedule visibility issues.<br />

Be sure to select <i> Steam Next Fest: Live Stream</i> in order to appear on the Event Schedule.
<strong>You can only create two of these special events per app!</strong> If you'd like to change
the timeslot you have scheduled, be sure to delete and create a new event prior to the start of Next
Fest. Once Next Fest begins, you will not be able to make changes.<br />
<br />
<strong
    >If you are testing your livestream setup, you should test by scheduling a regular livestream
    event type.</strong

<br />
Please note that Steam does not record broadcasts on your behalf, so if you'd like to replay a
livestream, you must record directly. <br />
