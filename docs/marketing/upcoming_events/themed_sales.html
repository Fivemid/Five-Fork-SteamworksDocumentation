<h1>Themed Sales Events</h1>
We occasionally organize themed sales events designed to showcase certain categories of games. These
events will have specific criteria for eligibility, and a process of invitation, registration, and
discounting. Each of these sales will be promoted on the homepage of Steam and organized into
sub-categories relevant for each event.<br /><br />Here is more information on how these events will
work.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Themed Sales Eligibility &amp; Invitation Process</h2>
Each themed sale event has different eligibility built around the core theme of the event. The
description should give you a pretty good idea of what games will be included in the event, usually
determined by the primary mechanic of the game. For each event, we will be selecting and inviting
eligible games where the primary theme or mechanic of the game is in alignment with the theme of the
sale.<br /><br /><strong>Selection process</strong><br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        Our selection team will start by pulling a list of games with the related tags applied to
        them. To make sure your game is considered for invitation to a themed sale, please make sure
        the store tags on your game are both truthful as to the content of your game and match the
        theme of the sale you are considering. For example, to be considered for the Racing sale,
        games need to have the racing tag applied to their game store page. To be considered for the
        JRPG sale, a game must have the JRPG tag.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Some games have a particular mode, or portion of the game that matches a theme. However, in
        order to be eligible, a game must be mostly about the theme above. For example, an adventure
        game with a racing mini-game in it is not eligible for the Racing Sale. So, our selection
        team will be filtering out games that are not built around the primary theme of the sale.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        From the resulting list of eligible games, we will be sending email invitations to the
        developers associated with each game. This will go to users with "Receive Steamworks
        Communication" permissions set in Steamworks.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Developers will have typically a month or more to register for the event and enter any
        desired discounts.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Event Visibility &amp; Promotion</h2>
These themed sales will be promoted on the homepage of Steam and on a dedicated sale page for the
duration of the event. The event may also be promoted through Steam social media channels and in the
pop-up marketing message. Event visibility can depend on the current schedule of Steam promotions,
but some examples of possible marketing visibility include:<br /><br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Game Visibility Within Each Event</h2>
Each themed event will be organized into sub-sections relevant for the theme. Some games may fit
neatly into multiple of those sub-sections while other games may only logically fit into a single
subsection. We'll do our best to balance the event and ensure that most games have a few logical
sections where players would expect to find the game.<br /><br />Within each section of the sale
page, games may be sorted in ways based on player interest and popularity, while other sections may
be more random.<br /><br />We cannot guarantee specific featuring or positions within each event.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<strong>Q. I don't see a themed sale that applies to my game. How can I participate?</strong
><br />A. Don't worry if you don't see a theme or genre that matches your game here - we'll be
hosting more of these throughout the year to shine a light on many of the interesting themes and
genres prevalent on Steam.<br /><br /><strong
    >Q. My game would fit neatly into more than one of these sales. How do I choose?</strong
><br />A. You'll need to pick the right event based on your game and the timing that works best for
your plans. In some cases your game may be eligible to participate in more than one sale without
conflict. In other cases, you'll have to choose between two events that are close together.<br /><br /><strong
    >Q. My game should be a fit for a themed sale. How do I make sure I get an invitation?</strong
><br />A. First, check the theme of the sale and make sure your game is tagged with relevant tags.
For example, games for the "Racing Sale" will be selected from games tagged with "Racing". Second,
make sure your account has '<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/managing_users"
    class="bb_doclink"
    >Receive Steamworks Communication</a
>' permission within your Steamworks partner account. <br /><br /><strong
    >Q. How do I get an invite if my game got missed?</strong
><br />A. If invitations have already gone out and you didn't receive one for a game that should fit
in an upcoming sale, please

    >contact us here</a
>.<br /><br /><strong>Q. Can I participate in a themed sale with my unreleased game?</strong
><br />A. Each themed sale may function a little differently, but for the most part they are
reserved for released games that are choosing to discount during the event. But keep an eye out for
specific information on each event, as some may contain opportunities for showcasing upcoming games
as well.<br /><br /><strong
    >Q. Will there be a place for players to discover games with playable demos?</strong
><br />A. There may be a demo section in some of the themed sale pages, but it is generally not the
emphasis of these events and it may depend on how many participating games have demos available.
