/><br /><br />The <strong>Steam Remote Play Together Sale</strong> is all about shopping for great
games and playing your favorites with your friends. This year's event runs February 28 - March 7,
2022 starting at 10am Pacific.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Eligibility</h2>
Any game that supports the Remote Play Together feature, and has enabled the "Remote Play Together"
feature on the game's store page, is eligible to participate. <br /><br /><strong
    >Adding Remote Play Together Feature Support</strong
><br />If your title has local multiplayer support, it may be a good candidate for the Remote Play
Together feature. The feature enables a player to invite a friend to join their game session via
Remote Play streaming, even when their friend doesnâ€™t own the game, or even have a Steam account, as
though they invited their friend over to their house. Remote Play Together can be a great way to
introduce new players to your title. <br /><br />The feature is enabled automatically for games that
are indicated to have Local Multiplayer, Local Co-op, or Shared/Split Screen capability, but you can
enable or disable it yourself to match whether this feature is appropriate for your game.
<br /><br />To enable the feature, edit your title's settings in the Steamworks Store Page Admin. On
the <i>Basic Info</i> tab, under<i> Supported Features,</i> check <i>Remote Play Together</i>.
<br /><br />For more details, please see the
