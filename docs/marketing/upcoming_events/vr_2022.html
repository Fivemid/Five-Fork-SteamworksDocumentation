<h1>Steam VR Fest (2022)</h1>
<strong>Steam VR Fest</strong> celebrates the immersive world of virtual reality.<br /><br />This
event runs July 18 at 10:00 AM PDT (GMT-7) to July 25 at 10:00 AM PDT (GMT-7) and will include
discounting, as well as sections for unreleased games and games with demos.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Eligibility</h2>
Games must have virtual reality capability in order to participate.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Invitation Process</h2>
We'll be inviting specific games to participate in Steam VR Fest based on the eligibility criteria
above. This invitation will go out to Steamworks users who have set "Receive Steamworks
Communication" permission for eligible games.<br /><br />The invitation will ask you to register
that game for Steam VR Fest, which is as easy as clicking one checkbox and saving. That registration
will tell us which games intend to participate.<br /><br />Once registered, users in your account
with "Edit Pricing Permissions" will then see the Steam VR Fest sale appear in the new discounting
approval tools and you can enter discounts for your game.<br /><br />If you have not received an
email invitation and believe that you have a game that fits the criteria described above, please

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="9"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<strong>Q. Do I need to register my game before entering a discount?</strong><br />A. Yes, you need
to do the following things in order:<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        Follow the link in the invitation email, or click this link to see your eligible games and
        register each:
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/optin/sale/vr_2022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >https://partner.steamgames.com/optin/sale/vr_2022</a
        ><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Once a game is registered, you can then enter discounts on the new Sale Approvals page here:
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/promotion/discounts/dashboard/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >https://partner.steamgames.com/promotion/discounts/dashboard/</a
        >
    </li>
</ol>
<br /><strong>Q. Will there be livestreaming as part of this event?</strong><br />A. Livestreaming
will not be featured on the sale page, but you are welcome to livestream on your own game's store
page(s) as you wish. Note that because of the way the SteamVR.exe service interacts with
broadcasting, you will need to use an external tool (such as OBS). That will give you the necessary
control to configure your broadcast and let you point Steam directly at your game appID rather than
SteamVR.exe. For more details, please see
