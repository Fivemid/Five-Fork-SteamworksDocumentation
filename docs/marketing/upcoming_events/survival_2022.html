/><br /><br /><strong>Steam Survival Fest</strong> is a Festival of Fortitude celebrating the
struggle to beat the elements with discounts and demos on current and upcoming survival games of all
kinds. <br /><br />This event runs August 1 at 10:00 AM PDT (GMT-7) to August 8 at 10:00 AM PDT
(GMT-7) and will include discounting, as well as sections for unreleased games and games with demos.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Eligibility</h2>
This event is targeted toward games that are primarily thought of as one of these types of games:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Survival<br /></li>
    <li>Survival Horror<br /></li>
    <li>Open World Survival Craft</li>
</ul>
<br />Participating games must have survival as the primary game mechanic. Survival games focus on
using defensive tactics to stay in the game—against destructive forces including nature or
supernatural beings—and typically include:<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">

    <li>Some adversity the player must overcome<br /></li>
    <li>Resource and health management (e.g. hunger and thirst)<br /></li>
    <li>The player trying to survive vs. attacking others who are trying to survive<br /></li>
    <li>
        Colony sim / building games with survival elements such as NPCs that attack or environmental
        damage the player needs to shelter from
    </li>
</ul>
<br />Examples of games that may not include survival (as described above) as the primary game
mechanic and thus may not be eligible include:<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Games in which the primary aim is to inflict harm on others, including battle royales and
        MOBAs<br />
    </li>
    <li>Multiplayer games with no specific survival component<br /></li>
    <li>MMOs with no specific survival component<br /></li>
    <li>Straight horror games<br /></li>
    <li>Pure Tower Defense games (though some survival games do have tower defense mechanics)</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Invitation Process</h2>
We'll be inviting specific games to participate in Steam Survival Fest based on the criteria above.
