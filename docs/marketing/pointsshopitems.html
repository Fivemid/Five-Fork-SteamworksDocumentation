        <h5>WHY SHOULD I CREATE ITEMS FOR THE POINTS SHOP?</h5>
        The Steam Points Shop represents a new way for fans to show off art from your game in their

        great way to increase the visibility of your game. So far, millions of players have
        exchanged Steam Points for these animated, game-themed collectibles.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="gameprofile"></a><strong>Game Profiles</strong></h2>
<h4>
    A Game Profile is a bundle of profile items that are themed together. It includes a new unique
    animated avatar, avatar frame, animated mini-profile background and an animated profile
    background. In addition to these assets, you will also need to customize the theme of the
    profile by entering 5 RGBA colors that make up different sections of the profile. These colors
    should compliment your art, but must not interfere with the legibility of the profile itself.
    Game profiles are great to theme around updates or new DLCs and you can have multiple per game.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="8"></a><strong>FAQ</strong></h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="9"></a>Rules and Guidelines</h2>
To ensure your Points Shop items are approved, here are some potential pitfalls to avoid:<br />
<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Do not use screenshots or images not tailored to the space.<br /></li>
    <li>Do not include game logos in the backgrounds.<br /></li>
    <li>Do not use footage that strobes or flashes (for epilepsy accessibility).<br /></li>
    <li>Use dark imagery that blends into black.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Use the full image space, images behind the profile content may be toned down, but should
        not be removed.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Assets must be all-ages appropriate, as they are not age gated. Regardless of what is
        included in-game, assets should not include nudity or adult content, or realistic gore.
        Valve will provide feedback on potentially inappropriate content.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="10"></a>Adult Content</h2>
Points Shop assets must be globally all-ages appropriate, as they are not age-gated. Regardless of
what is included in-game, assets should not include adult content or realistic gore. Adult content
includes:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Partial or full nudity<br /></li>
    <li>Sexually suggestive situations<br /></li>
    <li>Young-looking characters in risqué outfits or situations<br /></li>
    <li>Upskirt or upshirt imagery<br /></li>
    <li>
        Imagery where the central focus is sexually suggestive (ex: an image of a bra or panties).
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
Valve will provide feedback on potentially inappropriate content.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="11"></a>Review process</h2>
Once all your assets are uploaded, click the edit link beneath “Release State” to mark your assets
as ready for review. Once set as ready for review, your art assets will automatically appear in our
queue to review by Valve. This process typically takes 2-3 days and any necessary feedback will be
provided to you via the tool.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="12"></a>Releasing Points Shop Items</h2>
After your assets are approved, you'll see the status update on your Steamworks home page. You’ll
then be able to set the release state to “Released” and publish the items.<br />
<br />
NOTE: Once the assets are published changes are only permitted for errors.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="13"></a>Helpful Links</h2>
For templates and visual specs please refer to the Community Items under the Community tab page for
your Steamworks app admin page. From an app page select "Edit Steamworks Settings" under Technical
Tools, then under the "Community" tab you'll find the "Points Shop Items" page.<br />
