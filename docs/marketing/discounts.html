<h1>Discounting</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
Discounting can be a valuable tool to help grow your audience and extend the life of your product on
Steam.<br />We encourage you to participate in sales and take advantage of discounting tools where
it makes sense for your product. <br />In general, we've found that there is a customer at every
price point, and an effective discounting strategy can contribute to overall long term success on
Steam.<br /><br />As always, this advice is generalized for a huge variety of products, developers,
and customers, so take your own product and community into account when making decisions.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Configuring Discounts</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Required Permissions</h2>
Discounting requires the "Manage Pricing &amp; Discounts" permission for the relevant product. In
addition, you must be a member of the Steamworks partner that is getting paid for the product you
are trying to discount.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>How to Configure</h2>
1. Navigate to the landing page for the product you intend to discount by selecting the product from
your Steamworks home page.<br />2. On the landing page, you will see a section of store packages
listed near the top. Select the package you wish to discount.<br />3. On the package detail page,
click 'Edit discounts' in the package pricing section.<br />4. Click "New Discount."<br /><br />Repeat
these steps for each package you wish to discount.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Discounting Rules</h2>
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        You can run a launch discount, but once your launch discount ends, you cannot run any other

    </li>
    <li>
        Discounts for seasonal sale events cannot be run within 30 days of releasing your title or

</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="6"></a>Types of Discounts</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>Self-Serve</h2>
Partners are able to create and manage the following discounts on their own.<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="8"></a>Launch Discount</h2>
    Launch discounts start once your title is released on Steam and will last for 7 days. Generally
    launch discounts should be around 10% to 15%. There is a limit of 40%. Launch Discounts are
    optional.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="9"></a>Weeklong Deals</h2>
    Weeklong Deals begin every Monday morning at 10AM Pacific time and run for 7 days. Participating
    titles are featured on the Weeklong Deals landing page and included in a Steam News Post, which
    is syndicated to Twitter and Facebook. To participate in a Weeklong Deal, you will need to opt
    in at least two hours before that deal begins.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="10"></a>Custom Discounts</h2>
    You can configure your own custom discounts to align with special events like a major update or
    the anniversary of your products's release. You can schedule a custom discount to begin on the
    following calendar day.
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="11"></a>Curated</h2>
The following discount types are created and managed by Valve. When selecting titles to fill these
front-page promotional slots, we try to be as fair as possible and select titles that we feel
customers are most interested in and will result in the most happy customers. While there aren't
strict rules, as a base guideline we tend to focus on the top 10-20% selling games on Steam that are
positively reviewed and have otherwise proven to be successful. If your title qualifies for an
upcoming curated slot, we will contact you with details.<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="12"></a>Daily Deal</h2>
    These promotions run for 48 hours, starting at 10am Pacific time. Daily Deals are featured on
    the Steam homepage for 24 hours. See

    for more information.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="13"></a>Weekend Deal</h2>
    Weekend Deals run from Thursday at 10AM Pacific time until Monday at 10AM Pacific time, and are
    featured on the Steam homepage during that time.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="14"></a>Midweek Madness</h2>
    Midweek Madness promotions run from Tuesday at 10AM Pacific time to Friday at 10AM Pacific time.
    Midweek Madness deals are featured on the Steam homepage from Tuesday 10AM Pacific time to
    Thursday at 10AM Pacific time.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="15"></a>Free Weekends</h2>
    Free Weekends are promotions where customers have temporary access to your game. Users can try
    out the game for free, but lose access when the time period expires. This kind of offer is used
    strategically for certain types of games or circumstances, and is usually paired with a discount
    to help convert trial players to paying customers.

    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="16"></a>Seasonal Sales</h2>
    There are several sale events per year, which you may have the chance to participate in. Some of
    these, like the Summer Sale or Winter Sale, are open to all partners. Some may be only open to
    products of a certain category, like Anime or VR. You will receive announcements about these
    events ahead of time, as well as instructions for submitting discounts for your products.
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="bestpractices"></a>Discounting Best Practices</h2>
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="17"></a>Stairstep your discounts</h2>
    It's typically best to ease into discounting, and increase the level of discount over time. For
    example, a title might move from 33% to 50% to 66% to 75% and beyond, over the course of a year
    or more. Rushing into a 50% or 75% discount weeks after your launch, or releasing with a very
    high launch discount sends a bad message to customers who bought at full price and undermines
    the value of your title.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="18"></a>Time discounts to content updates</h2>
    When figuring out your discounting plan, try to make as big an event as possible, ideally tying
    to content updates as well. While the discount can attract interest, it's even better to show
    you are committed to your community by improving your product with content updates.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="19"></a>Take your sales decay curve into account</h2>
    It can be tempting to use small discounts in an attempt to climb the Top Sellers list or gain
    more exposure, but look carefully at how many customers are purchasing your product at full
    price before entering a discount. It's important for customers to feel good about their
    investment, so it's probably best to use discounts once you've settled into the tail of your
    sales curve.
    <h2 class="bb_subsection">
        <a name="20"></a>Discount all associated packages (DLC, Deluxe Editions) at the same time
    </h2>
    If your product has multiple editions or DLC, discount them all together. Discounting only part
    of your product, orputting the base game on sale this week and the Deluxe Edition next week,
    dilutes your exposure and prevents you from taking advantage of all the network effects of Steam
    that happen as more users get excited about your product at the same time. You might not want to
    match the discount on every package. For example, if one DLC is a year old, and the another just
    came out, it probably makes sense to choose a different discount percentage for each.
</ul>
<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>
        <strong>Note: Discount Stacking</strong><br />If a discount is already live on a product,
        any additional discounts besides those applied via Bundles will not affect the price of the
        game.

<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>Q: How are promotions scheduled? Can we bring ideas to Steam?</strong><br />A:
        Scheduling promotions has typically been a conversation between you and Steam. We may come
        to you with ideas, and if you feel you have an idea of a unique Curated Promotion, please
        contact us. But you can also set up your own discounts whenever works best for you, or you
        can opt into the regular weekly sales.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Q: Are promotions mandatory on Steam?</strong><br />A: No. We might invite you to
        take part in a special event or promotion, but there is nothing that you are required to
        participate in.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Q: How are discounts approved?</strong><br />A: For Curated Promotions, Valve will
        come to you with an idea for your approval if we think your title is a good fit for one of
        these promotions.<br /><br />For Self-Serve Promotions, once you set up your discount using
        our Discount tool, then your game will automatically go on sale at the date and time you
        specified.<br /><br />For detailed information about best practices with discounts, see
        <a href="#bestpractices" class="bb_doclink">Discounting Best Practices</a>.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Q: Can I update a discount?</strong><br />A: Yes, if your discount is not yet live,
        then you can edit or delete it.<br /><br />If you would like to adjust your Launch Discount,
        you can do so by going to your game's landing page and clicking the box next to the launch
        discount you have entered currently.<br /><br />If you would like to change a discount for
        an upcoming weeklong sale, custom discount or Steam-wide seasonal sale, then you will need
        to go to the staged discount, delete it and enter a new one.<br /><br />1. Navigate to the
        landing page for the product you intend to discount by selecting the product from your
        Steamworks home page.<br />2. On the landing page, you will see a section of store packages
        listed near the top. Select the package you wish to discount.<br />3. On the package detail
        page, click 'Edit discounts' in the package pricing section.<br />4. Click the Delete button
        next to the discount you would like to remove.<br />5. If you would like to enter a new
        discount to replace the one you just deleted, you can then click "New Discount"<br /><br />

            >Q: Can I participate in Steam-wide seasonal sale events if my product recently
            launched?</strong
        ><br />A: Generally, you cannot submit a discount within 30 days of release or 30 days from
        when the launch discount ends. However, if you submitted a launch discount and your product
        releases within 7 days of a Steam-wide seasonal sale events (like the Steam Summer Sale, for
        example), Valve can help you extend that introductory launch discount to last through the
        sale event.<br /><br />There are always future opportunities to put your game on discount,
        so you shouldn't feel pressured to change your release date for the sake of a seasonal sale
        event.<br /><br />If you decide you would like to extend your launch discount so that it
        lasts through a Steam-wide seasonal sale then please do the following
        <strong>BEFORE YOUR GAME IS RELEASED</strong>:<br />
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>
                Make sure your game's release falls within 7 days of a Steam-wide seasonal sale, if
                it does not, then this option does not apply to your game.<br />

            released?</strong
        ><br />A. You may run a launch discount and participate in the Steam-wide seasonal sales
        events when transitioning from Early Access to fully released, unless you have increased
        your product's price within the last 30 days.<br /><br />For more information, please see

        <strong>Q: How often can I discount my game?</strong><br />A: Custom discounts must be
        spaced at least 6 weeks apart and at least 1 month after the release of your product on
        Steam. Custom discounts don't affect eligibility for Steam-wide seasonal sale events. Note
        that the 30-day cool-down for new releases and price increases will still apply for the
        Steam-wide events.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Q: What happens if my discount time period overlaps with another discount?</strong
        ><br />A: Overlapping discounts will not get combined. If you do run a custom discount
        back-to-back to another sale, we do ask you to offer the same discount percentages.
