<h1>Steam Screenshots</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
Screenshot support is provided automatically through the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/overlay" class="bb_doclink">Steam Overlay</a>
to every game through Steam and Steamworks provides a set of APIs designed to interact with this
system. The Steamworks Screenshots API allows you to take screenshots and add them to a users local
screenshot library with additional metadata such as the name of a location in your game or tagging
users that appear in the screenshot.

Users can press a hotkey controlled by Steam (F12 by default), to trigger a screenshot.<br />
<br />
The user can change the hotkey and other screenshot settings that will take effect in any game they
play in Steam by going to Settings -&gt; In-Game.<br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Screenshot Uploader</h2>
Upon quitting a game the Screenshot Uploader will automatically open with all of the screenshots
that were taken during the previous session. Users can disable this behavior by going to Settings
-&gt; Cloud and unchecking "Open the screenshot uploader after closing game if screenshots were
taken".<br />

    title="screenshot_uploader.png"
/><br />
<br />
The Screenshot Uploader can also be accessed at any time through Steam by going to View -&gt;
Screenshots or by clicking on "Screenshots" in the Steam Overlay.<br />
<br />
If the user uploads any screenshots they will be visible on their community profile, and your games
community hub.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Steam Screenshots API</h2>
The Steamworks SDK provides access to
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamScreenshots" class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamScreenshots</a
>, and enables you to use advanced features and integrate the Steam Screenshots system right into
your game for the best experience for your customers.<br />
<br />
By default Steam will handle taking screenshots, but you can take over control by hooking the
screenshots using
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamScreenshots#HookScreenshots"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamScreenshots::HookScreenshots</a
>. If you're hooking the screenshots you'll be getting a
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamScreenshots#ScreenshotRequested_t"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ScreenshotRequested_t</a
>
callback when the user presses the screenshot hotkey. You can check if you're currently hooking
screenshots with
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamScreenshots#IsScreenshotsHooked"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamScreenshots::IsScreenshotsHooked</a
>.<br />
<br />
Regardless of whether you're hooking or not, you will be getting a
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamScreenshots#ScreenshotReady_t"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ScreenshotReady_t</a
>
callback when the screenshot has been successfully saved to disk. After receiving this callback you
should then check the result, and if it was successful, you can then use the
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamScreenshots#ScreenshotHandle"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ScreenshotHandle</a
>
provided to set tags with:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamScreenshots#SetLocation"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamScreenshots::SetLocation</a
        ><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamScreenshots#TagUser"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamScreenshots::TagUser</a
        ><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamScreenshots#TagPublishedFile"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamScreenshots::TagPublishedFile</a
        >
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
If you want to take a screenshot either with your own button, or automatically at some point, such
as the end of a round, you can do that programmatically with
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamScreenshots#TriggerScreenshot"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamScreenshots::TriggerScreenshot</a
>
or by writing the RGB bytes out with
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamScreenshots#WriteScreenshot"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamScreenshots::WriteScreenshot</a
>, or by adding a file from the disk with
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamScreenshots#AddScreenshotToLibrary"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamScreenshots::AddScreenshotToLibrary</a
>/<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamScreenshots#AddVRScreenshotToLibrary"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamScreenshots::AddVRScreenshotToLibrary</a
>.
