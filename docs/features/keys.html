<h1>Steam Keys</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
Steam keys are meant to be a convenient tool for game developers to sell their game on other stores
and at retail. Steam keys are free and can be activated by customers on Steam to grant a license to
a product. <br /><br />Valve provides the same free bandwidth and services to customers activating a
Steam key that it provides to customers buying a license on Steam. We ask you to treat Steam
customers no worse than customers buying Steam keys outside of Steam. While there is no fee to
generate keys on Steam, we ask that partners use the service judiciously.<br /><br />For more

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Types of Keys</h2>
Keys can be associated with the following package types:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>Standard</strong><br />This is the most common type of key on Steam, which is
        usually tied to a store or Steam Key package. These keys are appropriate for retail boxes or
        sales on other sites. These keys will unlock the product once it has been released and
        marked as playable on Steam.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Release Override</strong><br />These keys are used to grant access to a product
        prior to its release on Steam. Release Override keys are intended for small beta tests and
        press/influencer access. We will look at each request on a case by case basis, and in
        general less than 1000 keys work well for this purpose.
        <strong>It is never OK to sell release-override beta keys.</strong><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Dev Comp (or devcomp)</strong><br />These keys are intended for developer use only.
        They are used to automatically provide developers with access to the product. You should not
        need more than a handful of Dev Comp keys.
        <div class="bb_callout bb_red">
            <div>
                <strong>NOTE:</strong> Dev Comp keys should never be distributed to customers.
            </div>
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Steam Key Rules and Guidelines</h2>
<ul class="bb_ul %1$s">
    <li>
        You should use keys to sell your game on other stores in a similar way to how you sell your
        game on Steam. It is important that you don't give Steam customers a worse deal.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        It's OK to run a discount on different stores at different times as long as you plan to give
        a comparable offer to Steam customers within a reasonable amount of time.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Occasionally it may make sense to offer your game in a bundle or subscription, timed at the
        right point in a game's life cycle. Keep in mind that the perceived price in the
        bundle/subscription should be a price you are willing to run the game at a standalone price
        or discount on Steam. Philosophically, you can think about it like any other discount: if
        you’re making an aggressive offer in one place, make it elsewhere too.
        <strong
            >We want to avoid a situation where customers get a worse offer on the Steam store, so
            feel free to reach out to us via the Developer Support tool if you want to talk through
            a specific scenario. </strong
        ><br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Steam keys shouldn't be given away for free if you aren't also offering the same deal (i.e.,
        give the game away for free) to Steam customers. If you want to run a giveaway on Steam,
        please reach out to us and
        <a

            rel="noreferrer"
            >submit a ticket </a
        >.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Steam keys shouldn't be sold in bulk. For example, you should not sell your game on sites
        that offer customers the option to purchase large numbers of copies of your game for a lower
        price. You should also not include your game in bundles on sites that allow customers to
        purchase multiple copies of the bundle for a lower price.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        We reserve the right to deny requests for keys or revoke key requesting privileges for
        partners that are abusing them or disadvantaging Steam customers. <br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If we detect that you have requested an extreme number of keys and you aren't offering Steam
        customers a good value, we may deny your request.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        We reserve the right to remove key requesting privileges from any partner whose sole
        business is selling Steam keys and not providing value or a fair deal to Steam customers.<br /><br />Keys
        cannot be generated for the following:<br />
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>
                <strong>"Free" products</strong><br />If you want to give away keys for a free
                package or something that will never go on sale (event giveaways, special
                promotions, etc), please contact Valve.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Steam Bundles</strong> <br />Steam keys cannot be generated for Steam
                bundles. You will need to generate keys for the individual apps in the bundle.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Using Keys</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Requesting Keys</h2>
Keys are obtained by requesting them in the Steamworks portal. To request keys, click the "Request
Steam Product Keys" button on your application's landing page in Steamworks. If you don't see that
button, your account doesn’t have “Generate Steam Keys” permission.
<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>
        <strong>NOTE:</strong> Requests for large amounts of keys will be manually reviewed by Valve
        before processing.
    </div>
</div>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Retrieving Keys</h2>
Once processed, keys can be retrieved by clicking "Request Steam Product Keys" on your application's
landing page in Steamworks. Keys are available for download as a zip file which contains a plain
text file. Keys are only available for download by the user that requested them.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>Tagging Keys</h2>
It’s very important to tag your keys correctly so that you can keep track of them in the future. For
example, if you are requesting a batch of keys to be sold at retail in France, you can choose the
France tag. It’s a valuable accountability measure for you to keep track of your product’s sales on
other storefronts. <strong>Untagged key requests may be denied.</strong>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="8"></a>Querying Keys</h2>
If you need to look up a product key, you may do so from the<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/querycdkey/"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
>
    Query Steam Key</a
>
page.<br /><br />Note that only accounts which have "Request Steam Product Keys" permission may
query a key. And you may only look up a product key from a batch of keys that you requested, or if
it contains appIDs that you have product Key permissions on. If you attempt to look up a product key
that you don't have permissions on, or if the product key is invalid, you'll just get back that the
key is invalid.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="banning"></a>Banning Keys</h2>
If you need to ban product keys, that can be done from the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/partnerbatchbancdkeys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Ban Steam Keys</a
>
page.<br /><br />Similar to querying a key, you may only ban a product key that you have the rights
to. In the second step of the process, you can pick whether you wish to ban all keys in the batch,
or just keys that have not yet been redeemed. Please be very careful when banning product keys, as
you could be removing access from legitimate customers. <br /><br />You may ban keys to revoke
access from legitimate users (for example, the end of a beta) or to revoke keys that have been
stolen or purchased fraudulently. Once a key has been banned, it cannot be unbanned.<br /><br />If
you have a lot of keys to ban, you may want to break them up into groups of 10K per text file. The
Ban Steam Keys page will process larger batches, however, it may time-out giving an error when the
keys were indeed banned.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="9"></a>Additional Guidelines</h2>
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>Request keys in small batches.</strong> <br />Think carefully about how many keys
        you need. You may want to work with a smaller amount of keys and request more if necessary.
        Only provide as many keys to third party distributors as they will reasonably need. If you
        or any of your distributors make a mistake or something happens with those keys, you'll be
        in better shape if you don't have to worry about a large number of stolen keys. In general,
        you should treat keys like cash.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Be cautious with your Steam keys.</strong><br />We've heard many reports of
        fraudsters impersonating journalists or storefronts to acquire keys, and then reselling
        those keys for profit. <br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Pre-Purchases.</strong><br />We generally discourage developers from running
        pre-purchase offers on Steam. If you offer your product for pre-purchase outside of Steam,
        and that pre-purchase grants the user a Steam product key, those keys should unlock your
        product at the same time it is made available for purchase via Steam.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Beta Testing</strong><br />Keys are a great way to let players into your game early
        for testing or closed alpha/beta access. If you plan to run a larger beta that requires more
        than a few thousand release override keys, please reach out to Steam directly.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Bundles off Steam.</strong><br />You are free to use keys to distribute your product
        via bundle offers off Steam. We've learned from developers that pay-what-you-want bundles
        are a great revenue opportunity when your product is very far along its life cycle.
        <br /><br />As with any system that distributes your product keys, there is a non-trivial
        risk that bundle purchasers will actively resell keys to your product and undercut your
        full-price sales. Participating in a bundle is equivalent to running it at a very deep
        discount, and can damage the effectiveness of future promotions. Consult our Discounts &amp;
        Promotions Best Practices documentation for more information. <br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Crowdfunding.</strong><br />Keys can be used to fulfill crowdfunding rewards and
        grant backers access to your product. Providing backers with beta testing keys prior to
        release is also OK, but only backers should receive those keys --they shouldn’t be sold
        outside of the crowdfunding campaign unless your beta is also available for sale via Steam.
        <br /><br />Steam keys can only be promoted as a reward for products that have already
        confirmed Steam distribution -- it’s not OK to use the Valve or Steam logos to market a
        product that is not currently under Steam Distribution Agreement. For ongoing crowdfunding
        that does not have a set end date, it is only OK to sell Steam keys if the product is also
        available for purchase via Steam at no higher than it is offered via your crowdfunding
        campaign. If you are selling Steam keys for a beta or early access version of your product,
        you must follow the early access requirements listed below.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Keys and Early Access Titles.</strong><br />If you are requesting Steam keys to
        distribute or sell your Early Access title outside of Steam, you will need to include the
        materials specified in the
        <a

            rel="noreferrer"
            >Steam Early Access Branding Requirements</a
        >.<br /><br />Please note that Steam keys cannot be sold on other sites unless the product
        is also available for purchase on Steam at no higher a price than is offered on any other
        service or website.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="10"></a>FAQ</h2>
<br /><strong>Q:How can I use keys to test my product?</strong><br />A: Please see
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/testing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Testing On Steam</a
>
for more about testing with product keys. Alternatively, you could also run an external beta without
keys, check out the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/playtest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Steam Playtest</a
>
documentation for more information.<br /><br /><strong>Q: How many keys can I request?</strong
><br />A: You can request as many keys as you need, but your request will be reviewed on a case by
case basis by Valve staff to make sure Steam customers are being treated fairly and keys are not
being abused. <br /><br /><strong>Q: Why was my key request denied?</strong><br />A: Your request
may have been denied due to the amount of keys requested. If we detect that you have requested an
extreme number of keys and you aren't offering Steam customers a good value, we may deny your
request.<br /><br />It may also have been denied because the request was for a package that contains
a release state override. Release override keys make the content immediately playable upon
activation. Unless a request for testing/promo/press override keys is a small batch and properly
tagged for use, it may be denied. If the key request is intended for commercial purposes, be sure to
use a package that does not override the release state of your app.<br /><br /><strong
    >Q: Do I need keys for distributing a Steam version of my game at retail?</strong
><br />A: Whether you build a gold master or not, you will still need to deliver Product Keys for
any physical or digital retailer.<br /><br />Many retailers will want a self installing app package.
Use SteamPipe to create a retail install package based on the depots and install script you already
created for Steam. You can customize the installer with your own graphics and sounds appropriate to
your brand.<br /><br />If you can't or don't want to deliver the install package, you can simply
deliver a Steam activation code (a.k.a. Steam key) with instructions for redeeming the code on
Steam.<br /><br /><strong>Q: Will my Release Override keys expire when the app is released?</strong
><br />A: No, keys don't expire automatically. Any players who redeemed a beta key before the game
released will keep the game. If you need to revoke access after a closed beta, please read the
<a href="#banning" class="bb_doclink">Banning Keys</a> section above.<br />
