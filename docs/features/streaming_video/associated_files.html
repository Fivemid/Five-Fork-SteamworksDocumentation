<h1>Associated Software Files</h1>
For Videos, Series or Tutorial Videos, there may be non-video files that should be delivered to the
customer when the product is purchased. The current support for this is through an associated
software app that is created and linked to the video product. <br /><br />When a user purchases the
video product, the software app is added to the customers library in the Software section.

        If associated content is something you need for your video, please indicate that when
        submitting your request for a new Steam Video App.
    </div>
</div>
<br />At this time, videos that are purchased as gifts will not automatically grant the customer the
associated files. Customers who redeem the gifted copy can create a support ticket to have the
content added to their account.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="openfolder"></a>Open Folder Scripts</h2>
When the software application is created, the launch options are configured to use a set of scripts
that will open the folder containing the downloaded files. However, those scripts need to be
delivered as part of the contents delivered during install, i.e. part of the depot that is uploaded
for the software application.<br /><br />

    <li>
        Copy the files you want delivered as part of the software application into the Files
        folder.<br /><br /><img

        Run
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk/uploading" class="bb_doclink">Steampipe</a>
        to upload the files to your depot.
    </li>
</ol>
You should test the scripts are uploaded correctly using the Steam Client after setting the uploaded
build to a branch for testing.

        If you want to have an executable program for each OS that launches instead of opening the
        associated folder, you can update the launch options to point to the appropriate executable.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Releasing</h2>
You will not be able to submit the associated software application for review, nor will you be able
to self-release it at this time. <br /><br />After the video has been reviewed and approved for
release, please
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/home/contact_steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Contact Us</a

and submit a ticket to have the software reviewed and released for you. This may take 2-3 business
days, so please submit the ticket well in advance of your launch.<br />
