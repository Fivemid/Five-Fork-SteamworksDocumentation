<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
The Steam Video Upload feature allows a partner to directly upload the video file to be processed
into the video system. Once processed, the video will be available for configuration and release to
customers. The documentation below highlights the functionality of the Video Upload page.<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Video Upload Tab</h2>
To upload your video, navigate to the landing page for the video and click Manage Video, then from
the Video tab, select Upload.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Main Input File</h2>
The main input file refers to the MP4 file that contains the default video and audio track that a
user would watch. If you do not have alternate language, audio commentary tracks, etc., this is the
only file you will need to upload.<br />
<br />
Steps:<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        Set the file using the File Chooser or drag-and-drop the file into the Input File box.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Once the main input file has been selected, it should load into the Main Input File Preview.
        This is a direct load from your computer for visual reference only. You should use it to
        confirm you've selected the correct file for upload, and for review if you are setting the
        Video Type or Crop options.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Alternate Video and Audio Files</h2>
If your video has additional audio or video tracks (languages, audio dubs, commentary tracks,
alternate angles, sound mixes, etc.) you can supply those files using the Alternate Video and
Alternate Audio section.<br />
<br />
Additional Notes:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Alternate tracks can not currently be uploaded at a different time than the main input file.
        Please upload the main and alternate video files all at one time.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Alternate Files should follow the same settings as per the main file<br /></li>
    <li>Alternate Video files can contain an audio track but it will currently be ignored<br /></li>
    <li>Alternate Audio files can be in either be an MP4 container or AAC format<br /></li>
    <li>
        Once uploaded and processed, the alternate tracks can be configured in the Video Management
        tab
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
Steps:<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>Click Add Alternate Video (or Add Alternate Audio as appropriate)<br /></li>
    <li>In the File Chooser that appears, select the alternate MP4 file to upload</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Video Type</h2>
Use this dropdown to select the type of video content that is being processed. This will adjust the
conversion process according to the content type to deliver a higher quality stream for
customers.<br />
<br />
Options:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Use Animation for animated, cel-shading, tutorial videos, etc.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Use Film (with grain) when the original video has a dark or existing grain look. This
        conversion process will attempt to keep as much of the grain as possible.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Use Film for all other cases</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="6"></a>Cropping</h2>
Unlike video solutions that are only plugged into TVs, Steam customers have a large variety of
monitors in different resolutions and aspect ratios. To better support this variation and in
particular ultra-wide monitors, we recommend delivering videos with no black bars when aspect ratios
are wider than 16:9. In addition, by not wasting encoding time and bit rates on the black bars, the
actual contents of the video can be encoded faster and at a better rate.<br />
<br />
Options:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>If you have already cropped the video to the actual content, select No Cropping<br /></li>
    <li>
        To automatically remove any black bars (above/below or left/right), select "Automatic
        Cropping (Remove Black Bars)". The conversion process will scan the first 5 minutes of the
        video for determining the regions to remove.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Choose Manual Cropping and set the parameters if you know exactly where to crop. Width and
        Height refer to the final frame size after cropping. X/Left and Y/Top represent the point to
        start the crop from.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="7"></a>DRM</h2>
By selecting Enable DRM, your video will be encrypted using Google Widevine. This is transparent to
the user as the Widevine decryption module is installed by Steam silently. Upon playback, the video
player will both confirm ownership of the video in Steam and grant a time-restricted license for
playback that allows for decryption of the video content for playback.<br />
<br />
For videos with a rental option, we recommended enabling DRM as the time-restricted license will be
matched to the end of the rental period.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="8"></a>Advanced Options</h2>
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Optimize Upload for Faster Network Connections (Disable for slow connections or if timeouts
        occur) - This will increase the number of simultaneous connections during upload. It does
        require at least 6Mbps upload. If a video upload fails, turns this setting off and try
        again.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="9"></a>Upload and Job Details</h2>
Once the upload form has been filled in, click the Upload button to begin the upload of all the
files to the Steam processing service. The Job Details section will indicate the progress for each
upload in process.<br />
<br />
Once the upload is complete, the Video Upload tab can be closed. Navigating away from the video tab
during upload will result in a warning dialog confirming you wish to continue. Should you do so, the
upload process will be stopped.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="10"></a>Processing Time</h2>
The processing of a video takes 1.5x-2.0x the runtime of the video files uploaded. If a processing
job fails, a Valve representative will contact you directly.<br />
<br />
