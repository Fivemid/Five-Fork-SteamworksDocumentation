<h1>Game Servers</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
The Steam Game Servers API provides everything you need to create dedicated
servers for your game. You can host these game servers yourself, or allow your
community to host them for you. This is the best choice for highly competitive
games (such as Dota 2) or games with persistent servers that stay around after
players leave (such as Team Fortress 2).

A large part of the game server experience on Steam comes from the unified
server browser.<br /><br />Players can open the server browser from the steam
client or in the
