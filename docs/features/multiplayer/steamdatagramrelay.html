<h1>Steam Datagram Relay</h1>
Steam Datagram Relay (SDR) is Valve's virtual private gaming network. Using our APIs, you can not
only carry your game traffic over the Valve backbone that is dedicated for game content, you also
gain access to our network of relays. Relaying the traffic protects your servers and players from
DoS attack, because IP addresses are never revealed. All traffic you receive is authenticated,
encrypted, and rate-limited. Furthermore, for a surprisingly high number of players, we can also
find a faster route through our network, which actually

    >improves player ping times</a
>.<br /><br />This relay network can be used for both peer-to-peer traffic and dedicated servers. In
both cases, you will need to use the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets" class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamNetworkingSockets</a
>
interface.<br /><br /><strong>This is a cross platform service</strong> A Networking API and DDoS
solution for a cross-platform game is useless if it only works on one platform. As long as you ship
your game on Steam and meet some other reasonable requirements, you can access the Steam Datagram
Relay for players on other platforms or stores! Please contact us for the relevant SDKs and to talk
about the fine print. And if you don't ship on Steam, feel free to use the
<a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/GameNetworkingSockets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >opensource</a
>
version of the API for whatever you want.<br /><br />For <strong>peer-to-peer</strong> traffic, all
you need to do to take advantage of SDR is to use APIs such as

and

    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets#ConnectP2P"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamNetworkingSockets::ConnectP2P</a
>. Steam will take care of everything else.<br /><br />The remainder of this document applies to
dedicated servers.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>General Requirements for Dedicated Servers</h2>
In order to run dedicated servers behind SDR, you'll need to do the following:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Any place where clients see the IP address of your server will need to be changed to use a
        different identifier instead, probably the server SteamID.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Your server <i>will</i> still need a public IP, so that it can receive traffic from relays.
        However, this IP can be dynamic, and it will never be revealed to players. (NOTE: At this
        time, only IPv4 is supported, but IPv6 support is planned.)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        You'll need to modify your networking code to use
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets" class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamNetworkingSockets</a
        >
        for connectivity. (Note that this API also supports plain UDP transport, which is very
        useful for testing. Also, there's an opensource version.)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        You'll need some way for players to learn the SteamID of your server. Note specifically that
        the
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamMatchmaking" class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamMatchmaking</a
        >
        and
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamGameserver" class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamGameserver</a
        >
        APIs use public IP to refer to dedicated gameservers, and cannot be used for this purpose.
        It's OK to use lobbies, so long as the server IP is never revealed to players.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />The peer-to-peer APIs work just fine even when one "peer" is a dedicated server! But there's
one important catch: if your dedicated server is not near one of the data centers where we are
running relays, then the relayed route might be slower than the ordinary IP route that players would
get using plain UDP connectivity. (You will normally not enable NAT punch for dedicated servers,
since that reveals the IP address of the server and opens it up to DDoS attack.)
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Dedicated Servers in Known Data Centers</h2>
For the optimal dedicated server experience, the server should be run in a known data center that is
part of the SDR network, where we make sure that relays are running nearby and the relayed route is
never slower than the "direct" route. Servers running in these known data centers connect using a
special API. This use case is referred to in the SDK as "Hosted Dedicated Server". Note that this
doesn't mean that Valve is hosting the servers, only that they are hosted in a data center that is
known to the Steam Datagram Relay system. At this time, we are only supporting the major cloud and
gameserver providers such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. (As well as our own data
centers -- see below.)<br /><br />If you are running servers in a major provider and want us to run
relays near your servers so that you can take advantage of SDR, please get in touch with us!<br /><br /><strong
    >NOTE:</strong
>
Carrying this sort of traffic is a beta feature, and is not a Steamworks feature we can offer to all
partners at this time. There may be technical or capacity issues that prevent us from offering it to
all partners.
<h2 class="bb_section">
    <a name="3"></a>Simple Connection Flow to Dedicated Server Without Game Coordinator
</h2>
If you don't have your own central matchmaking / login service (we sometimes call this the "game
coordinator") that assigns players to servers, or just want to keep things as simple as possible,
then you can connect to a dedicated server in a known data center using
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets#CreateListenSocketP2P"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamNetworkingSockets::CreateListenSocketP2P</a
>
and
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets#ConnectP2P"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamNetworkingSockets::ConnectP2P</a
>. In this case, the connection begins on the client just like an ordinary P2P connection.
Rendezvous messages are sent through Steam, so if the player or server loses their connection to
Steam, the connection cannot be made. Also, Steam does not restrict who can attempt to connect,
aside from verifying that the player is signed into Steam and owns the game.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Ticket-Based Server Connection Flow</h2>
If you do have your own game coordinator service, it is recommended to use a ticket-based connection
flow. This is slightly more complicated, but it offers several advantages over using simple
P2P-style connection calls. First, you only issue tickets to players who should be allowed to
attempt to connect. Second, once a player has a ticket, they can connect to the server even if they
lose connection to Steam, or their computer crashes. This can be very important for games with
penalties for leaving the game.<br /><br />A ticket-based connection to a dedicated server over SDR
works like this:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        When your game server logs into your game coordinator, it sends up its
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/steamnetworkingtypes#SteamDatagramHostedAddress"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >SteamDatagramHostedAddress</a
        >, which is an opaque blob that contains physical routing information. (See
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets#GetHostedDedicatedServerAddress"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamNetworkingSockets::GetHostedDedicatedServerAddress</a
        >). Also, note that we have some tools you can use to assist with authenticated login to
        your game coordinator.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The server begins listening for relayed traffic using
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets#CreateHostedDedicatedServerListenSocket"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamNetworkingSockets::CreateHostedDedicatedServerListenSocket</a
        >.<br />
    </li>
    <li>At some point, your client wants to enter matchmaking or connect to a server.<br /></li>
    <li>
        The client can use the methods in the
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingUtils" class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamNetworkingUtils</a
        >
        interface to obtain ping times to data centers and check connectivity. You will probably
        want the client to send this information to your game coordinator, so it can make good
        decisions about how to assign players to data centers.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        When your game coordinator is ready to authorize a client to connect to a server, it
        generates a
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/steamnetworkingtypes#SteamDatagramRelayAuthTicket"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >SteamDatagramRelayAuthTicket</a
        >
        and signs it with your secret key. This ticket authorizes a specific client to talk to a
        specific gameserver, for a limited amount of time. It also contains the encrypted routing
        information. The game coordinator sends the ticket to the client.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The client caches the ticket in a local cache. (See
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets#ReceivedRelayAuthTicket"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamNetworkingSockets::ReceivedRelayAuthTicket</a
        >
        for more information, including why the extra complication of the cache is useful.)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The client uses
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets#ConnectToHostedDedicatedServer"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamNetworkingSockets::ConnectToHostedDedicatedServer</a
        >
        to connect to the server. See
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets" class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamNetworkingSockets</a

        for further details about how to send and receive messages.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Configurating servers in known data centers</h2>
<br />This section documents some technical details involved in configuring servers.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Authentication</h2>
SDR uses two authentication mechanisms:<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <i>Relay tickets</i> are issued by your game coordinator and authorize a specific client to
        talk to a specific dedicated server for a period of time. Relay tickets are only used for
        the dedicated server use case.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Certificates</i> are used in the traditional way to authenticate, and perform DH key
        exchange to establish an encrypted channel. Certificates are an end-to-end concept, and can
        be used in all forms of SteamNetworkingSockets communication, including direct UDP
        connectivity or P2P.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />We use a proprietary public key infrastructure (PKI) to authenticate clients and servers.
Players are issued individual, short-term certificates, tied to their specific player identity.
Steam takes care of this. For gameservers, we typically use longer term certificates that authorize
an entire data center for a particular AppID. You will issue those certificates.<br /><br />Before
you can issue tickets and certificates, you'll need to generate a keypair and send us your public
key. We will publish a certificate signed by our master CA key that marks your key as trusted for
your app(s). Then, offline you will generate a certificate for each data center where you want to
run servers, using our certificate tool, and sign it with your private key. You'll distribute those
certificates to your gameservers over a secure channel, passing it to your server in the environment
(see below).<br /><br />You'll also use your key to generate tickets, each time a player connects to
a gameserver.<br /><br />Keep your CA private key and the private keys of your certificates safe! If
your key leaks and needs to be revoked and replaced, it could lead to a disruption.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>Environment variables</h2>
The dedicated server gets its configuration from environment variables. Note that in Valve data
centers, all of these values will be set automatically for you.<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>SDR_LISTEN_PORT</strong>: The UDP port where your server will receive traffic from
        relays. The dedicated server only uses a single socket. (But you can have more than one
        logical "listen socket" by using "virtual ports". See
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets#CreateHostedDedicatedServerListenSocket"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >ISteamNetworkingSockets::CreateHostedDedicatedServerListenSocket</a
        >.) In our data centers, we typically use the 30xxx range.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>SDR_IP</strong>: Your server must have a public IP that can receive "unsolicited"
        traffic from relays. If the server only has one interface with a public IP, then this will
        be used. Otherwise, you will need to tell the gameserver what IP to use. The SDR socket will
        be bound to INADDR_ANY, but this information is needed to fill out the server's
        <a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/steamnetworkingtypes#SteamDatagramHostedAddress"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >SteamDatagramHostedAddress</a
        >. Note in particular that this will usually need to be set in dev environments, where your
        server is behind a corporate firewall. (See below.) You can also specify a port, if the
        public port differs from SDR_LISTEN_PORT.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>SDR_POPID</strong>: The 3- or 4-letter alphanumeric code (<a
            href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/steamnetworkingtypes#SteamNetworkingPOPID"
            class="bb_apilink"
            >SteamNetworkingPOPID</a
        >) of the data center, in production. In development environment, leave this blank.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>SDR_PRIVATE_KEY</strong>: The private key from your certificate. It's an OpenSSH PEM
        block that begins with "-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----".<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>SDR_CERT</strong>: Your signed certificate. It's a proprietary format PEM-like block
        that begins with "-----BEGIN STEAMDATAGRAM CERT-----".<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>SDR_NETWORK_CONFIG</strong>: Full path to a local, recent copy of the SDR network
        configuration file for your app. If this variable is not set, then to obtain the network
        configuration the server will fetch the copy using HTTP at boot time. For optimal
        performance you can periodically (e.g. once an hour) download the latest configuration and
        save it locally, so that a network hiccup doesn't cause any disruption. This is how Valve
        servers are configured.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="8"></a>Running in a dev environment</h2>
Because
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets" class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamNetworkingSockets</a
>
supports plain UDP connectivity, it's usually best to start by getting your code working through
this interface over UDP, without worrying about relays.<br /><br />We suggest that your server code
use the presence of the SDR_LISTEN_PORT environment variable to decide whether your server should
listen for SDR. You can use
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets#GetHostedDedicatedServerPort"
    class="bb_apilink"
    >ISteamNetworkingSockets::GetHostedDedicatedServerPort</a
>
to fetch the value.<br /><br />In development, you will leave SDR_POPID blank. When SDR_LISTEN_PORT
and SDR_POPID is blank, the POPID is set to the special 3-character code "dev".<br /><br />In
general, authentication is disabled for servers in the "dev" environment. (Clients and relays will
both allow connections to "dev" servers without a signed cert, as long as they have a signed
ticket.) You will need another mechanism to authenticate with your game coordinator. And your game
coordinator needs to be careful when it issues tickets to any servers claiming to be in "dev"!<br /><br />Your
server needs to be able to receive unsolicited public traffic, which means that if it doesn't have a
public IP, you'll need to setup a port forward in your firewall. And you'll probably need to set
SDR_IP with the proper public IP (and port, if it differs from SDR_LISTEN_PORT).
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="9"></a>Game Coordinator SDK</h2>
"Game Coordinator" is the term we use to refer to backend / matchmaking services. There is a
separate, small SDK that you can link with your game coordinator which can be used to:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Issue tickets to give clients access to gameservers hosted behind SDR<br /></li>
    <li>
        Parse with
        <a

            >PingLocation_t</a
        >
        strings and calculate ping times between these objects<br />
    </li>
    <li>Take advantage of certain other advanced features.</li>
