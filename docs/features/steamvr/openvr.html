<h1>OpenVR</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
OpenVR is an API and runtime that allows access to VR hardware from multiple vendors without
requiring that applications have specific knowledge of the hardware they are targeting. This
repository on GitHub is an SDK that contains the API and samples. The runtime is under SteamVR in
the "Tools" library in the Steam client.<br />
<br />
Documentation for the API is available on the

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>OpenVR Drivers</h2>
Hardware device makers can develop OpenVR drivers to easily enable support for VR content on
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Steam</a>. Steam is one of
the largest digital distribution platforms worldwide, with thousands of games available.<br />
<br />
Once you have created an Open VR driver, you may distribute it yourself or directly on Steam to
