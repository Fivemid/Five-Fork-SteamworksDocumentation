<h1>Restricting Tradability After Market Purchases</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>To help reduce fraud, Valve requires all marketable items to also be temporarily untradable after purchase for a minimum of three days. While it is possible to also temporarily restrict the marketabiltiy of items, we have found that it is not necessary to do so, and that only restricting tradability is sufficient to reduce fraud.<br><br>Without restricting tradability after a purchase, fraudsters are able to monetize stolen credit cards by purchasing items using those stolen cards and then trade them to somebody who has agreed to purchase them for cash. Restricting tradability allows for our systems to catch that fraud for you while the items can still be recovered from the fraudster's account.<div class="bb_callout bb_red"><div><strong>NOTE:</strong> The <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/inventory" class="bb_doclink">Steam Inventory Service</a> automatically applies our recommended cooldowns as needed.

You'll want to do this at the same time you change ownership of the item in your <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/inventory/economy/TradeSetOwned" class="bb_doclink">TradeSetOwned</a> implementation, but only when <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">is_market</code> is set to <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">1</code> and <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">audit_action</code> is set to <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">101</code> (Trade Commit).<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Add something to the asset class to indicate that the temporary restriction is active</h2>You'll need to add something to the item's asset class (in the <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/inventory/economy/GetContextContents" class="bb_doclink">GetContextContents</a> and <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/inventory/economy/GetAssetClass" class="bb_doclink">GetAssetClass</a> response) to indicate that the temporary restriction is active and when it expires. An item's asset class is a black box to Steam, so how you do this is completely up to you. We recommend adding a new class property with <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">instance</code> set to true, <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">name</code> of something like <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">tradable_after</code>, and <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">value</code> of the time/date the restriction ends, rounded to the nearest day boundary. Rounding to the nearest day boundary reduces the number of unique class combinations, and thus improves Steam's ability to cache your <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/inventory/economy/GetAssetClassInfo" class="bb_doclink">GetAssetClassInfo</a> responses.<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Tell Steam and the user that the item is untradable</h2>While the temporary restriction is active, you'll need to make sure the <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">tradable</code> field in your <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/inventory/economy/GetAssetClassInfo" class="bb_doclink">GetAssetClassInfo</a> response is false. Keep in mind that it is OK to have an item where <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">tradable</code> is false, but <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">marketable</code> is true.<br><br>You also need to make sure Steam refreshes this information once the temporary restriction passes. To do this, set <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">cache_expiration</code> to the RFC 3339 UTC formatted time that the item will become tradable (or the time any part of the GetAssetClassInfo response will change). The time that the item will become tradable should have been passed in as part of the asset class as explained in the section above.<br><br>It's also nice to remind the user why the item is untradable. You can include a description under <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">owner_descriptions</code> that also includes when the restriction will be removed. To make sure the user sees the correct time in their timezone, you can set the <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">type</code> of the description to <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">bbcode</code> and then place <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">[date]####[/date]</code> somewhere in the <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">value</code> of the description where <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">####</code> is the Unix timestamp for the time the restriction will be removed. Alternatively, you can say something like "The item will become tradable in 3 days", but then you have to remember to set the <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">cache_expiration</code> appropriately.<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Expose to Steam that this restriction will be added following a purchase</h2>To do this, you simply need to set the <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">market_tradable_restriction</code> field to <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">3</code> (or however many days purchased items will be untradable) in your <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/inventory/economy/GetAssetClassInfo" class="bb_doclink">GetAssetClassInfo</a> response. This value is used to indicate to Steam and users that the item will be untradable for that many days if it were to be purchased on the market. Thus, this value has nothing to do with whether or not the restriction is currently active for an item, and should just always be a constant value of 3 or more for all marketable items.
