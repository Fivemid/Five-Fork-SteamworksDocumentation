            </li>
            <li>
                We often find videos encoded at 23.976 fps have subtitles that are encoded at 24 fps
                and those subtitles will drift out of time over the course of playback. While other
                video platforms may correct these for you, Steam won't. Please ensure your subtitles
                are created at the same frame rate as your video itself.
