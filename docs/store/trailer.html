<h1>Trailers</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
As part of the release process on Steam, you will be required to upload a trailer for your product.
Trailers are displayed at the top of your product's store page and are often one of the first things
your potential customers will be seeing.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Best Practices</h2>
Trailers are important in marketing your product on Steam. You want to think about the context of
where your trailer will appear. For example, the customer may be going through their Discovery Queue
and looking at games that are recommended to them, and you may have less than 10 seconds to make an
impression. Or the customer may be watching your trailer without any audio. You will want to think
about how long it takes for the customer to learn about your product, and if they can learn about it
without audio.<br /><br />Check out this presentation from Steam Dev Days 2016 for general best
practices for trailers:<br /><a

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Uploading a Trailer</h2>
You can go to the Store Page Admin &gt; Trailers tab to upload your trailer. The trailer should be
the highest resolution that you have, up to 1920 x 1080 resolution, 30/29.97 or 60/59.94 fps, high
bit rate (5,000+ Kbps) and in .mov, .wmv, or .mp4 container files. H.264 video and AAC audio is
preferred, but we can transcode from many formats. 16:9 aspect ratio is preferred since the Steam
client is optimized for widescreen, but 4:3 aspect ratio is accepted. Please note that audio will be
filtered down to regular stereo when we transcode the videos.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Advanced Settings</h2>
The Advanced Settings can be used if you have trailers in multiple languages or need to restrict
them to certain countries. You will not need to use the Advanced Settings if your trailer is visible
to all countries and languages.<br /><br />You can set the language that specific trailers will show
to customers that have their settings set to that language. The Base video should be set to the
English trailer if you have trailers in multiple languages. See

    >Localization and Languages</a
>
for more information.<br /><br />If you have PEGI and ESRB rated videos that should only appear in
certain countries, you can restrict the visibility of your trailer to certain countries by using the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >ISO 3166-1 alpha-2</a

language codes. (Example: DE,FR,US,CA,MX)
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>My Trailer is Stuck Converting!</h2>
The trailer processing system works in a FIFO queue. If there is a long queue of trailers ahead of
yours, then it may take a few hours to complete the conversion. The position in the queue is
reported for each trailer in the Trailers tab. Note: Deletion / re-submission will move the trailer
to the back of the queue.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="6"></a>My Trailer processing ended with an error!</h2>
The most common reason for a trailer to fail is the resolution of the video. Please ensure you use a
common resolution such as 1920x1080 or 1280x720 to avoid any downstream processing issues. Another
common issue is an unsupported audio sample rate (please use 44Khz or 48Khz).
