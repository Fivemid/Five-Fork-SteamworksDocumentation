  <li>
    <h4>Q. When can I stream? How often am I allowed to Stream?</h4>
    A. You can stream as often and as long as you want. We have seen partners
    run continuous streams that go longer than a couple days. Its up to you to
    decide when are the best times to reach your customers with the live
    content. <br /><br />Also consider that Steam customers are around the
    world. Sometimes after major events, it might be valuable to replay past
    content so that all your potential customers and fans can see it.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Q. Can I re-broadcast a previously live stream?</h4>
    A. Yes. You must include banner or update title so that it indicates that
    the Stream is NOT live. This is prevent customer confusion. Often streaming
    partners will put a banner 'Re-Broadcast' on the top right of their video.

    <h4>Q. Does the live stream have to be exclusive to Steam?</h4>
    A. No, the live stream content does not have to be exclusive to Steam. It is
    perfectly fine to maximum your reach by streaming on multiple platforms such
    as Twitch, YouTube, Facebook etc... . You can stream directly from your
    setup or you can use a platform like
    <a href="http://#restream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Restream</a> to
    multi-cast for you.<br /><br />It is fine for the content to have premiered
    on another streaming platform and then replay it on Steam (original or
    edited version). We strongly recommend visually indicating that the stream
    is a replay with an overlay on the video. It is fine to indicate where the
    original content premiered. <br />

  <li>
    <h4>Q. Can I stream a game not yet released?</h4>
    A. Yes. As long as you are planning to release the game on Steam and have
    created a Coming Soon page, you can stream your game on Steam. This can be a
    great way to give a preview to your community, collect feedback, and build
    excitement around your game.<br />

  <li>
    <h4>
      Q. Can I overlay my username or handle from another site on Steam
      broadcast?

    A. Yes. <br />
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Q. Can I display ads in my feed?</h4>
    A. Yes, but it is strongly discouraged since doing so creates a bad user
    experience.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Q. Can I broadcast a prerecorded feed?</h4>
    A. Absolutely. This can be a good option if you want to show more than a
    gameplay video. You can show your offices, the development team, and craft a
    narrative that gives additional context for your game.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Q. What about mature content in the stream?</h4>
    A. As long as the mature content is for a game that has mature rating on
    Steam, it should be fine. <br />
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Q. Can I showcase multiple games within a single Stream?</h4>
    A. Yes. You can create stream that will showcase multiple of your games
    without restarting the stream. To ensure customers know which game is being
    played, we recommend as the games change within the stream, that the
    'Broadcast App ID' is updated on your
    <a
      href="https://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/upload/"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noreferrer"
      >Broadcast Settings page</a
    >. AppID changes are applied immediately to a live stream but it may take a
    few minutes for store pages to update.<br /><br />Please note that the
    streamer needs all of the applicable games in their library ahead of the
    streaming session. The AppID will not update if the game is missing from the
    streamer's library.
