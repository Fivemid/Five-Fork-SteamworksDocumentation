<h1>Setting Up A Stream</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
In this tutorial, we will walk you through the steps required to broadcast your game on the Steam
storefront.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Before You Begin</h2>
<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>Note: Games marked as "Adult-Only" cannot be streamed on the Steam store.</div>

<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        You will need a non-limited Steam account. “Non-limited” means that the Steam account you
        plan to stream from must have spent at least $5 USD on the Steam store. “Limited” accounts
        (accounts that have not spent at least $5 USD on Steam) will not be able to create an RTMP
        token and will not be able to stream to a store page on Steam.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The account you plan to stream from must own the game it will be streaming from. You can
        check this by logging into the Steam client with this account and confirming you see the
        game in your Steam Library.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The account must either have the "Broadcast Live" permission in the Steamworks partner
        account, or be a member of the

        >
        group.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Setting up your Stream using RTMP</h2>
<br />The steps below will help you gather the information required to stream your game from
third-party broadcasting software. Streaming on Steam uses the RTMP protocol. You won’t need to know
exactly how this protocol works to stream on Steam, but some familiarity with the below concepts
will be helpful.<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        1. Go to
        <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/upload/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >http://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/upload/</a
        >
        <br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        2. Check the Upload Server. Steam will automatically select an upload server that’s close to
        your current location based on your IP address. If you want to select a different upload
        server, you can do so using the list on the page. The computer that is streaming your game
        will send video to the upload server, so it’s important to pick one that will have the
        lowest latency possible, usually the one geographically closest to you.<br /><br /><img

            alt="stream1.png"
            title="stream1.png"
        /><br /><br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        3. Locate your RTMP token. You will need to enter this token into your streaming
        software.<br /><br /><strong>What is an RTMP token?</strong><br /><br />An RTMP token is a
        unique identifier to allow you to stream on Steam. You will generate this token at
        <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/upload" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >https://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/upload</a
        >, and enter it into the software you plan to use to stream your game to Steam.
        <div class="bb_callout">
            <div>
                <u>Important</u>: Treat your token like a password, and Never share it, as anyone
                who has it can stream as you. If you believe your key is compromised, you can
                invalidate it and generate a new one on this page.
            </div>
        </div>
        <br /><img
            src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/stream2.png"
            alt="stream2.png"
            title="stream2.png"
        /><br /><br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        4. Enter Your Game's AppID<br /><br />You can see your game’s App ID by visiting your game’s
        App landing page in Steamworks or going to your game’s Steam store page--your appID is in
        the URL.<br /><br />Note that you should only use the appID for your “base” game--do not use
        the appID for DLC, Demos, Soundtracks, or other secondary application types.<br /><br /><img

            title="stream3.png"
        /><br /><br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        5. Set Your Broadcast Permissions<br /><br />By default, your stream is set to “Friends
        Only”, which means it’s only visible by you and your friends on Steam. This is a good way to
        test your stream before it’s publicly visible on your store page. It will be visible by
        clicking the “Your broadcast URL” under Quick Links on this page. Once you are ready for
        your stream to appear publicly on your store page, you can change this permission to
        “Public”.<br /><br /><img

            title="stream4.png"
        />
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Setting up OBS <i>(Optional)</i></h2>
There are several software tools available for streaming your game to Steam. OBS is a popular free
and open-source option. Below are steps to get your stream set up in OBS. Steam supports any
broadcast software that supports the RTMP protocol.<br />
<br /><img
    src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/stream5.png"
    alt="stream5.png"
    title="stream5.png"
/><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>1. Navigate to File--&gt;Settings--&gt;Stream<br /><br /></li>
    <li>
        2. In the dropdown menu, select “Custom...”<br /><br /><img
            src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/stream6.png"
            alt="stream6.png"
            title="stream6.png"
        /><br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        3. In the “Server” field, enter the “Upload Server” you selected at
        <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/upload/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >http://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/upload/</a
        ><br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        4. In the “Stream Key” field, enter the token provided at
        <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/upload/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >http://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/upload/</a
        ><br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        5. In OBS, navigate to File--&gt;Settings--&gt;Output<br /><br /><img
            src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/stream7.png"
            alt="stream7.png"
            title="stream7.png"
        /><br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>6. Under Output Mode, select “Advanced” in the drop-down menu.<br /></li>
    <li>
        7. On the Streaming tab, enter Keyframe Interval to 2.
        <u>Note: This step is important. Without this setting your stream will fail to start.</u>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Testing Your Stream</h2>
Once you are ready, begin streaming your game using OBS. Next, go back to
<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/upload/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >http://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/upload/</a
>
and look for a link to the right of the page called “Your Broadcast URL”.<br /><br /><img
    src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/stream8.png"
    alt="stream8.png"
    title="stream8.png"
/><br /><br />You should see your gameplay being streamed on this page. At this point, if you set
your broadcast permission to “Friends only”, your stream is not public yet.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="steamevent"></a>Create a Steam Event For Your Game</h2>
It's a good idea to let your community know about your stream. You can do this using the Event tools
on Steamworks. Below is a brief guide to setting up a Live-Stream/Broadcast event. You can learn
more about Events on Steam here:
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/event_tools" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/event_tools</a
>.<br /><br />Follow these steps:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        1. From your game’s App Landing Page, Click “Post New Event” (or whatever it says)<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        2. Select “Live-Stream/Broadcast” <br /><br /><br /><img
            src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/stream10.png"
            alt="stream10.png"
            title="stream10.png"
        /><br /><br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        3. Navigate to the “Broadcasting” tab<br /><br /><br /><img
            src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/stream11.png"
            alt="stream11.png"
            title="stream11.png"
        /><br />
        <br /><br />This is where you will designate one or more Steam accounts as allowed to stream
        to your store page during the event. Enter a title for your broadcast from the list, or
        enter your own. If you enter a custom name, don’t forget to add localized titles.<br /><br /><img
            src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/stream12.png"
            alt="stream12.png"
            title="stream12.png"
        /><br /><br /><br />Add the account you intend to Stream with:<br /><br /><br /><img
            src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/stream13.png"
            alt="stream13.png"
            title="stream13.png"
        /><br /><br /><br /><u>Important:</u> The Steam account setting up the stream and the
        account that is streaming must be friends in order for it to be visible on this page.<br /><br /><strong
            >Suggested but optional:</strong
        >
        upload artwork (which you can re-use in the future) for your livestream. This artwork will
        appear on both sides of your livestream. <br /><br />Click the “Save” button to save your
        event.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        4. Go to the “Options” tab and confirm the start and stop times of the event are correct.
        You can continue your stream for up to 24 hours past the end time of your event.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        5. Enable the broadcast feature on the event<br /><br /><img
            src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/stream14.png"
            alt="stream14.png"
            title="stream14.png"
        /><br /><br />• Save and publish your event. When you start streaming during the event, your
        stream will appear on your store page. Note that There may be a delay up to 5 minutes before
        the stream is picked up on the store page once you start streaming, so you may want to begin
        the stream a few minutes early to account for this.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Troubleshooting:</h2>
<br />Q: I don’t see my broadcast on my Steam store page!<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        A.You may need to refresh the product page after a few seconds. We only display the live
        broadcast once a connection is established. First viewers will take the longest to establish
        the connection to the broadcaster.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Confirm that you have entered the right appID at
        <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/upload" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >https://steamcommunity.com/broadcast/upload</a
        >. The appid is used to connect the stream to the correct game. If the appid is missing, the
        Steam store product page will not show the stream and it will not be featured on the front
        page. You will need to enter the appID and regenerate the RTMP token and enter it into your
        broadcasting software.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="specs"></a>RTMP Streaming Specs</h2>
If your stream is using external software to stream content to steam, then this section applies. At
this time, Steam requires these encoding specs to be set. If you're having issues with videos
stuttering, pausing, or not playing back correctly, please check the following:<br /><br /><strong
    >Video encoding requirements</strong
><br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Codec: H.264<br /></li>
    <li>Profile: High<br /></li>
    <li>Level: 4.1<br /></li>
    <li>Frame Rate: 30 FPS or 60 FPS<br /></li>
    <li>Frame Ratio: 16:9<br /></li>
    <li>Keyframe interval: 2 seconds<br /></li>
    <li>Maximum bitrate: 7000 kbps CBR</li>
</ul>
Audio encoding requirements<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>Codec: AAC-LC<br /></li>
    <li>Maximum bitrate: 128 kbps</li>
</ul>
<br /><strong>Streaming Software Notes</strong><br />VMIX: By default, VMIX uses Profile Main and
Level 3.0. You must change those settings in order for VMIX to stream correctly to Steam.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="7"></a>Content Rules</h2>
Remember to obey the content rules when broadcasting on your product page. Those rules can be found
in the FAQ under the answer to 'What kind of content is restricted?'. Valve may moderate streams
that violate these rules, or take other action on offending partner accounts, including termination.
