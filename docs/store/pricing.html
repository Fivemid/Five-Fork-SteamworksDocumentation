<h1>Pricing</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
Partners on Steam are responsible for setting and managing pricing for their products. The
Steamworks Developer site provides tools to configure pricing and discounts in all the currencies
supported by Steam. Initial pricing as well as proposed pricing adjustments will be reviewed by
Valve and are usually processed within one or two business days. We recommend pricing strategies
based on our experience and we may suggest prices based on currency conversions and other factors.
During processing we will attempt to check your prices for input errors, but we can't guarantee we
will catch every one so please check your prices carefully before submitting.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Pricing Types</h2>
Steam supports multiple business models that games use to price content, whether it be the single
purchase of a full game, DLC, in-game microtransactions or recurring subscriptions. This article
focuses mostly on package pricing, which is the purchase option that shows up to customers on the
game's Steam store page. <br /><br />Other pricing include in-game microtransactions and recurring
subscriptions. More information can be found here regarding implementation of these pricing
types:<br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Required Permissions For Editing Pricing</h2>
Only certain publisher accounts have the necessary permissions to enter or adjust pricing or
configure discounts for your products on Steam. For new Steamworks partners, the default account is
the Steam account that completed the digital paperwork for the Steam Distribution Agreement. But the
appropriate person at your organization may vary.<br /><br />If you don't have the necessary
permissions as detailed below, the best bet is to contact one of your Steamworks administrators,
which is a user within your organization that has the ability to grant permissions. A list of your
Steamworks administrators can be found on the right column of your Steamworks home page (unless you
are an administrator yourself).<br /><br /><br />The following permissions are required for a
specific account in order to set or adjust pricing for a product:<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        The Steamworks partner that you are a member of must be the partner getting paid for sales
        of the product. For example, if you are working on a game with another studio and that other
        studio is marked as the entity getting paid for sales of the game, then only members at that
        other studio will have the ability to change prices.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Your account must have the specific permission: "Manage pricing and discounts" for the
        product in question. See

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="best_practices"></a>Pricing Best Practices</h2>
When thinking about the launch price of your game, you'll want to consider a few different
factors.<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>How long will it take customers to play through your game?<br /></li>
    <li>Is the game highly replayable?<br /></li>
    <li>Does it offer multiplayer?<br /></li>
    <li>Are you launching in Early Access?<br /></li>
    <li>How are games of a similar nature priced?<br /></li>
    <li>Are you pricing with future promotions in mind?</li>
</ul>
<br />If you’re serious about the business of selling your game, you should treat it like any other
business endeavor, and do some market research. Buy and play other similar games. Read user reviews
and customer feedback to get a sense of how much value customers are getting, and use that data to
make your own pricing decisions. It’s not about trying to undercut competition with a lower price.
Instead, focus on understanding the market and making sure your customers are getting great value
for the money they’re spending.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<strong
    >Q: My game is missing some of the local currencies that Steam supports, does that
    matter?</strong
><br />A: Not having pricing entered for all applicable currencies prevents users from making a
purchase. For example, if you do not have a price entered for Japanese Yen, then users located in
Japan will be unable to purchase your game.<br /><br /><strong
    >Q: What currencies does Steam support?</strong
><br />A: A full list of currencies can be found in the
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/pricing/currencies"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >Supported Currencies</a
>
page, which also includes information on which currencies support pricing and purchasing in partial
unit amounts, how they're reported and in what increments.<br /><br /><strong
    >Q: How often can I change the price of my product?</strong
><br />A: We suggest that you wait at least two months after release before you change your price.
That is the same period of time you should wait until you first offer a discount on your title.<br /><br /><strong
    >Q: Can I schedule my price updates to happen automatically?</strong
><br />A: No, pricing changes cannot be scheduled to happen automatically, but you have the option
to publish prices changes on your own schedule after Valve reviews them, or have Valve publish them
immediately after review.<br /><br />If you choose to publish price changes yourself, after the
price changes have been reviewed by Valve, you will be notified via email. You'll be then given an
option to publish your future price change at a time that is convenient for you. Once you publish
the changes, they'll immediate be live for customers.<br /><br />This option can be found in the
Propose Pricing section of the package landing page.<br /><br /><img

    alt="pricechangeschedule.JPG"
    title="pricechangeschedule.JPG"
/><br /><br /><strong
    >Q: Can I raise the price of my game when transitioning from Early Access to fully
    released?</strong
><br />A: Yes. You'll need to request a price change a couple days ahead of your Early Access
transition to ensure that it is approved prior to your transition.<br /><br />Note that it's not
possible to discount your product for 30 days after any price increase. If you increase your price
within 30 days of your transition from Early Access to fully released, your launch discount will not
apply.<br /><br />If you're planning on raising your price at or around the time of releasing out of
Early Access and want to run a discount to celebrate your V1.0 release, you may want to consider
these scenarios:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        You could leave your price as is, run a discount as you release V1.0 out of Early Access and
        then raise your price after that.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        You could raise your price as you transition out of Early Access and not run a discount.
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        You could raise your price more than 30 days before you release out of Early Access, and
        then run a discount to go with your V1.0 release.
    </li>
</ul>
<br /><br /><strong
    >Q: Can I participate in major sale events if my product recently launched?</strong
><br />A: Generally, you cannot submit a discount within 30 days of release or 30 days from when the
launch discount ends. However, you can submit a launch discount to take effect when your game first
releases, and if your product releases within 7 days of a major sale event (like the Steam Summer
Sale, for example), Valve can help you extend that introductory launch discount to last through the
sale event.<br /><br />There are always future opportunities to put your game on discount, so you
shouldn't feel pressured to change your release date for the sake of a seasonal sale event.<br /><br /><strong
    >Q: What if I want to change my game from free to paid?</strong
><br />A: You're welcome to change your game from free to paid, so please use the
<a
    href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithPublishing?issueid=915"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >support form here</a
>
to contact us to change from a Free to Play game to a paid package. Treating customers fairly is the
most important thing to us, so if your game will no longer have in-game purchasing when changing
from Free to Play to a paid package, then we ask that you give your customers at least 30 days
notice before removing in-game purchasing, so that customers have fair warning and get a chance to
use up any remaining in-game currency or items before they no longer are purchasable or consumable.
<br /><br /><strong>Q: What if I want to change my game from paid to free?</strong><br />A: Similar
to changing from free to paid, if you would like to change your game from paid to free, please use
the
<a
    href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithPublishing?issueid=915"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >support form here</a
>
to let us know. Again, we'd ask that you give your customers at least 30 days notice before changing
so that they can make an informed decision whether or not to buy a game that's intending to change
its business model in the near future.<br /><br /><strong
    >Q: Does Steam pricing support games with paid ads?</strong
><br />A: No. Steam does not support paid ads or referral/affiliate revenue from showing ads to
other games and/or products or services. If your game's revenue relies on advertising on other
platforms, you will need to find a new model to ship on Steam. However if you have a game that is ad
supported, and you want to ship it on Steam, you could consider having your game be a single
purchase or making it free to play with microtransactions or additional content as DLC.<br /><br /><strong
    >Q: Does Steam pricing support "paywall" games?</strong
><br />A: No. Steam does not support models where a customer is blocked and needs to pay to continue
playing. If you would like to have a free demo to show off your game, you're welcome to do so. Your
demo and full game can share files as well to continue game play. To figure out if a demo is the
right thing for your game, please check out the
