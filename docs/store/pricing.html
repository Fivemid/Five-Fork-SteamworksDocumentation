<h1>Pricing</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
Partners on Steam are responsible for setting and managing pricing for their
products. The Steamworks Developer site provides tools to configure pricing and
discounts in all the currencies supported by Steam. Initial pricing as well as
proposed pricing adjustments will be reviewed by Valve and are usually processed
within one or two business days. We recommend pricing strategies based on our
experience and we may suggest prices based on currency conversions and other
factors. During processing we will attempt to check your prices for input
errors, but we can't guarantee we will catch every one so please check your
prices carefully before submitting.
<h2 class="bb_section">
  <a name="2"></a>Required Permissions For Editing Pricing
</h2>
Only certain publisher accounts have the necessary permissions to enter or
adjust pricing or configure discounts for your products on Steam. For new
Steamworks partners, the default account is the Steam account that completed the
digital paperwork for the Steam Distribution Agreement. But the appropriate
person at your organization may vary.<br /><br />If you don't have the necessary
permissions as detailed below, the best bet is to contact one of your Steamworks
administrators, which is a user within your organization that has the ability to
grant permissions. A list of your Steamworks administrators can be found on the
right column of your Steamworks home page (unless you are an administrator
yourself).<br /><br /><br />The following permissions are required for a
specific account in order to set or adjust pricing for a product:<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
  <li>
    The Steamworks partner that you are a member of must be the partner getting
    paid for sales of the product. For example, if you are working on a game
    with another studio and that other studio is marked as the entity getting
    paid for sales of the game, then only members at that other studio will have
    the ability to change prices.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    Your account must have the specific permission: "Manage pricing and
    discounts" for the product in question. See

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="best_practices"></a>Pricing Best Practices</h2>
When thinking about the launch price of your game, you'll want to consider a few
different factors.<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
  <li>How long will it take customers to play through your game?<br /></li>
  <li>Is the game highly replayable?<br /></li>
  <li>Does it offer multiplayer?<br /></li>
  <li>Are you launching in Early Access?<br /></li>
  <li>How are games of a similar nature priced?<br /></li>
  <li>Are you pricing with future promotions in mind?</li>
</ul>
<br />If you’re serious about the business of selling your game, you should
treat it like any other business endeavor, and do some market research. Buy and
play other similar games. Read user reviews and customer feedback to get a sense
of how much value customers are getting, and use that data to make your own
pricing decisions. It’s not about trying to undercut competition with a lower
price. Instead, focus on understanding the market and making sure your customers
are getting great value for the money they’re spending.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<strong>Q: How often can I change the price of my product?</strong><br />A: We
suggest that you wait at least two months after release before you change your
price. That is the same period of time you should wait until you first offer a
discount on your title.<br /><br /><strong
  >Q: Can I raise the price of my game when transitioning from Early Access to
  fully released?</strong
><br />A: Yes. You'll need to request a price change a couple days ahead of your
Early Access transition to ensure that it is approved prior to your
transition.<br /><br />Note that it's not possible to discount your product for
30 days after any price increase. If you increase your price within 30 days of
your transition from Early Access to fully released, your launch discount will
not apply.<br /><br />If you're planning on raising your price at or around the
time of releasing out of Early Access and want to run a discount to celebrate
your V1.0 release, you may want to consider these scenarios:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
  <li>
    You could leave your price as is, run a discount as you release V1.0 out of
    Early Access and then raise your price after that.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    You could raise your price as you transition out of Early Access and not run
    a discount. <br />
  </li>
  <li>
    You could raise your price more than 30 days before you release out of Early
    Access, and then run a discount to go with your V1.0 release.
  </li>
</ul>
<br /><br /><strong
  >Q: Can I participate in major sale events if my product recently
  launched?</strong
><br />A: Generally, you cannot submit a discount within 30 days of release or
30 days from when the launch discount ends. However, you can submit a launch
discount to take effect when your game first releases, and if your product
releases within 7 days of a major sale event (like the Steam Summer Sale, for
example), Valve can help you extend that introductory launch discount to last
through the sale event.<br /><br />There are always future opportunities to put
your game on discount, so you shouldn't feel pressured to change your release
date for the sake of a seasonal sale event.<br /><br /><strong
  >Q: What if I want to change my game from free to paid?</strong
><br />A: You're welcome to change your game from free to paid, so please use
the
<a
  href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithPublishing?issueid=915"
  target="_blank"
  rel="noreferrer"
  >support form here</a
>
to contact us to change from a Free to Play game to a paid package. Treating
customers fairly is the most important thing to us, so we ask that you give your
customers at least 30 days notice before removing in-game purchasing, so that
customers have fair warning and get a chance to use up any remaining in-game
currency or items before they no longer are purchasable or consumable.<br /><br /><strong
  >Q: What if I want to change my game from paid to free?</strong
><br />A: Similar to changing from free to paid, if you would like to change
your game from paid to free, please use the
<a
  href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithPublishing?issueid=915"
  target="_blank"
  rel="noreferrer"
  >support form here</a
>
to let us know. Again, we'd ask that you give your customers at least 30 days
notice before changing so that they can make an informed decision whether or not
to buy a game that's intending to change its business model in the near future.
