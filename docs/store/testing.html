<h1>Testing On Steam</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
In order to properly test your application on Steam, you should understand how Steam delivers files
to the user.<br /><br />Before getting started you should be familiar with all of the concepts
outlined in the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application" class="bb_doclink">Applications</a>
documentation.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Dev Comp Packages</h2>
As a Steamworks developer, you have a special type of packages attached to your publisher group.
This package is called a Dev Comp Package, and it controls what App IDs and Depot IDs your developer
accounts will own automatically when logging into Steam. Just because you have added a new depot to
your application or to your build doesn't mean you can test it. You need to ensure that new DepotID
is listed in your Dev Comp Package or the package you are using to test your game. You can see the
contents of your Dev Comp packages by selecting the application from your Steamworks home page,
selecting the Associated Packages and DLC link and then selecting the package you wish to view the
contents of.<br /><br />If you are having trouble getting your files to download in Steam, launch
"Steam.exe -dev", go to the Console Tab, and enter the command
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">licenses_for_app 999999</code> where 999999 is your
AppID you are trying to test. This will display the package ID that is being used to determine what
content you own for that AppID and it should display the DepotIDs in that package as well. If you
are missing DepotIDs, you will need to edit the package to include them. For more information on
editing packages, please see

>.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="internal"></a>Enabling Internal Testers</h2>
You will obviously need to test your application yourself before release and you may have other
employees that you wish to grant access to help test. The best way to enable these employees to test
is by adding them to your Steamworks account. By default, the first user created in a Steamworks
account is granted administrative permissions and access to the default application being worked on.
That user can then add more users to help develop and test the application. You can read more about
adding new users in
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/managing_users" class="bb_doclink"
    >Managing Your Steamworks Account</a
>.<br /><br />Additionally, you can request keys for a package that will grant immediate access to
your application. To learn more about the different types of packages and requesting keys, please

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="external"></a>Setting up a closed beta</h2>
<br />Running a closed beta or private beta is easy and free on Steam. It’s a great way to get
feedback and test the user experience through Steam, and does not require you to launch the game
into Early Access or provide permanent free access to your testers. These instructions will walk you
through providing closed beta access to your community, and ending the beta when you’re ready. If
you’re interested in releasing a beta version of your game that any customer can buy, check out
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/earlyaccess" class="bb_doclink">Early Access</a>.
<br /><br />1. First, upload a build of your game for your beta testers to play. If you haven't done
this yet, check out the instructions
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk/uploading" class="bb_doclink">here</a> first and
come back to this page later.<br /><br />2. Next, we strongly recommend setting up your
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/coming_soon" class="bb_doclink">Coming Soon</a>
page. This provides a reference opportunity to test your marketing presence against the experience
players are having in game. It also provides the Steam Community Hub as an easy place for your
community to discuss the game and provide feedback, and makes it easy for users to Wishlist your
game. <br /><br />3. Request keys from your “Beta Testing” release override package. Any customer
who activates one of those keys can instantly download and play, so don’t hand them out until you’re
ready. Take a minute to review the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/keys" class="bb_doclink"
    >Steam Key documentation</a
>
so you know what the rules are and how the key request process works.<br /><br />4. Keep track of
the keys you hand out. By default, users who activate a key will own the game forever, but if you
want to end beta access or revoke the game from beta testers, that’s fine too. When you’re ready to
end beta access, revoke the keys using the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/partnerbatchbancdkeys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >key banning tool</a
>. You can indicate that you’re banning the keys because of the end of a beta, so users get a
friendly message letting them know they’ve lost access. <br /><br />Note: If you’d like to provide a
different version of the game to different audiences, that’s easy to do. For instance, you might
have beta testers playing one branch, but provide Press/Influencer access to a separate branch.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="dlc"></a>Testing DLC</h2>
Testing a DLC is very similar to testing a game. The DLC has an AppID, and that AppID needs to be in
a Dev Comp package that you own (or acquired with a Key) in order to test. Some DLCs contain content
and others are just used as a license check by the game to determine features to unlock. You can
toggle the ownership (license) on and off using the Steam Console (launch Steam.exe -console), and
then using the command
<code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">enable_license</code>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Adding Friends to Test</h2>
If you have brand-new Steam accounts that you need to be friends in order to test multiplayer
functionality in your game, you will need to take some extra steps to add them as friends of
one-another.<br /><br />By default, new accounts are limited in how they can participate in the
Steam Community (for more details, please see
<a
    href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3330-IAGK-7663"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    >Limited User Accounts</a
>). This will prevent you from sending friend requests from a new Steam account. You can get around
this in one of two ways:<br />
<ol class="bb_ol ">
    <li>You can initiate the friend request from a non-limited account<br /></li>
    <li>
        You can activate a Dev Comp type key for your game on one of the new accounts, which will
        grant the game to that account and will de-limit that account and allow you to send friend
        requests from it.
    </li>
</ol>
