<h1>Coming Soon</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
You can put up a Coming Soon page for your product well in advance of your release date. This way,
you can let customers know the title is coming to Steam and start building an audience and
excitement around your product. For new products, you must have a Coming Soon page up for at least
two weeks before releasing.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Benefits</h2>
Once your store page is visible to customers, it can help you build awareness for your product and
generate excitement among potential customers. As soon as you have product branding, screenshots, a
description and video showing your game, you can put up a 'coming soon' page to start utilizing the
tools available on Steam. And you can update your store page whenever you need to once it's live.<br /><br /><strong
    >Activates Community Hub:</strong
>
Once your store page is visible to customers, it will also enable the Community Hub. This gives you
a place to post announcements, share artwork, and gives your audience a place to share their
enthusiasm and discuss your upcoming release.<br /><br /><strong>Allows for Wishlists:</strong> Once
your store page is visible to customers, interested people can start adding your title to their
wishlist. Once you reach your release date and hit the 'release' button, Steam will automatically
send an e-mail to those people with your game on their Steam Wishlist.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Getting Set Up</h2>
<strong>Preparing:</strong> To post your page as Coming Soon, you will first need to create a new
application, complete your release checklist and have your page reviewed and approved by Valve. To
do this, click "Create New App..." on your Steamworks dashboard and then follow the checklist on
your product landing page. Everything in the "Your Store Presence" section is required prior to
posting your store page.<br /><br /><strong>Getting Reviewed:</strong> Once you have your checklist
complete, you'll need to hit the "Mark As Ready For Review" button in the top section of your
product landing page. This will make your product visible to Valve for review and approval prior to
release.<br /><br /><strong>Posting:</strong> Once your page has been approved, you will need to
click the green "Post as Coming Soon" button for it show to show up publicly as coming soon.<br /><br />For
more information on preparing for release, please see the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/releasing" class="bb_doclink">Release Process</a>
documentation.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Where &amp; How It Appears</h2>
<strong>Release Date Display:</strong> You can control how your release date appears and how
specific you are ready to be. Within your 'Edit Store Page' section, you'll find a section that lets
you define how your date should appear, whether as the actual intended release date or as a custom
string such as 'Spring'.<br /><br /><i
    >NOTE: Once your Coming Soon Page is live, you will be unable to change your release date
    without contacting us here. Please set your date as close to your actual release date as
    possible.<br />
    <br />Itâ€™s fine to change your release date-- plans change, delays happen, and you control the
    timing of your release on Steam. But we do want customers to see honest and accurate information
    on the store.</i
><br /><br /><strong>Pricing:</strong> While you do need to have pricing entered and approved prior
to making your coming soon page live, the price will not appear to customers. You may also change
your pricing as you wish prior to release.<br /><br /><strong>Visibility:</strong> 'Coming soon'
pages can show up in search and on appropriate 'upcoming' lists within the store. And, like any game
on Steam, your game can show up in organic ways as fans share links within the Steam Community and
elsewhere.<br /><br /><i
    >NOTE: Once your Coming Soon page is live, third-party services will be able to scrape your
    game's metadata - including stats &amp; achievements. Stats and achievements won't be displayed
    anywhere in the Steam Community, but they may show up on other sites.</i
