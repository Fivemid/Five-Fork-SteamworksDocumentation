<h1>Coming Soon</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
You can put up a Coming Soon page for your product well in advance of your release date. This way,
you can let customers know the title is coming to Steam and start building an audience and
excitement around your product. For new products, you must have a Coming Soon page up for at least
two weeks before releasing.<br />
<br />
It is recommended that you publish your Coming Soon page as soon as possible. Right when you begin
talking about your game publicly, you should launch your Coming Soon page to start collecting
feedback and let customers
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/wishlist" class="bb_doclink">Wishlist</a> your
game.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Benefits</h2>
Once your store page is visible to customers, it can help you build awareness for your product and
generate excitement among potential customers. As soon as you have product branding, screenshots,
and a description of your game, you can put up a 'coming soon' page to start utilizing the tools
available on Steam. And you can update your store page whenever you need to once it's live.<br />
<br />
<strong>Activates Community Hub:</strong> Once your store page is visible to customers, it will also
enable the Community Hub. This gives you a place to post announcements, share artwork, and gives
your audience a place to share their enthusiasm and discuss your upcoming release.<br />
<br />
<strong>Allows for Wishlists:</strong> Once your store page is visible to customers, interested
people can start adding your title to their wishlist. Once you reach your release date and hit the
'release' button, Steam will automatically send an e-mail to those people with your game on their
Steam Wishlist.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Getting Set Up</h2>
<strong>Preparing:</strong> To post your page as Coming Soon, you will first need to create a new
application, complete your release checklist and have your page reviewed and approved by Valve. To
do this, click "Create New App..." on your Steamworks dashboard and then follow the checklist on
your product landing page. Everything in the "Your Store Presence" section is required prior to
posting your store page.<br />
<br />
<strong>Getting Reviewed:</strong> Once you have your checklist complete, you'll need to hit the
"Mark As Ready For Review" button in the top section of your product landing page. This will make
your product visible to Valve for review and approval prior to release.<br />
<br />
<strong>Posting:</strong> Once your page has been approved, you will need to click the green "Post
as Coming Soon" button for it to show up publicly as coming soon.<br />
