These are the standard store graphical assets. Most of these are required as part of setting up your
game on Steam.<br /><br />

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="1"></a>Capsule Guidelines</h2>
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Store page capsule images should contain a readable product logo/name and have accurate
        dimensions.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Capsule images should not contain URLs or operating system/platform/store logos.<br /></li>
    <li>Capsule images should have PG-13 appropriate artwork.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section">
    <a name="header_capsule"></a>Header Capsule <span style="color: #ca5029">Required</span>

    alt="header.jpg"
    title="header.jpg"
/><br /><br /><strong>Usage:</strong> This appears at the top of the store page, in the 'Recommended
For You' section, in 'Grid View' in the Steam client, in browse views on Big Picture mode, and for
Daily Deals if applicable.<br /><br /><strong>Design:</strong> This image should focus on the
branding of your product. For best results, please use the same artwork that you use for any retail
box or marketing and make sure the logo is clearly legible.<br /><br /><strong>Size:</strong> Please
provide '460px x 215px' . A '292px x 136px' image will be automatically generated from this.
<h2 class="bb_section">
    <a name="small_capsule"></a>Small Capsule <span style="color: #ca5029">Required</span>
</h2>

    alt="capsule_231x87.jpg"
    title="capsule_231x87.jpg"
/><br /><br /><strong>Usage:</strong> These are used for all the lists throughout Steam. Search
results, top-sellers, new releases, etc. <br /><br /><strong>Design:</strong> These are small, so
for best results focus on making the logo clearly legible. <br /><br /><strong>Size:</strong> Please
provide '231px x 87px' image. From that, two smaller sizes (120x45 and 184x69) capsules are
automatically generated.<br /><br /><strong>Requirements: </strong>Small Capsule should contain
readable logo, even at smallest size. In most cases, this means your logo should nearly fill the
small capsule.

    title="capsule_616x353.jpg"
/><br /><br /><strong>Usage:</strong> This image appears at the top of the Steam store home page in
the Main Capsule carousel. <br /><br /><strong>Design:</strong> For best results, please use the key
art and logo that is being used for any retail boxes or marketing. Avoid using quotes or other
strings of text beyond the title of your game. The game's logotype should be easily legible against
the background. The art used for them should immediately tell the customer something important about
the game. It should be graphically-centric and give the user some sense of the game-play. Avoid
placing the logo/title in the lower right corner of the capsule image where it might be obscured by
promotional overlays.<br /><br /><strong>Size: </strong>616px x 353px

    title="dotascreenshot.jpg"
/><br /><br /><span style="color: #ca5029"
    >Screenshots should exclusively show the gameplay of your game. This means avoiding using
    concept art, pre-rendered cinematic stills, or images showing awards, marketing copy, written
    descriptions, and so on. Please show customers what your game is actually like to play. Menu
    screens should only be included if they are a unique component of your game.</span
><br /><br /><strong>Usage:</strong> Screenshots are displayed on your store page, and on other
pages where your game may be featured such as the Steam homepage. You must provide at least 5
screenshots of your product.<br /><br /><strong>Design:</strong><br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Formatting - For best results, please provide screenshots in high-res, widescreen format.
        Any images you upload to the ‘screenshot’ section of your store page should be screenshots
        that show your game. This means avoiding using concept art, pre-rendered cinematic stills,
        or images that contain awards, marketing copy, or written product descriptions. For elements
        such as marketing copy, awards you’d like to show off, or descriptions of your Deluxe
        Edition, please use the specific spaces already available on your store page rather than
        including it in your screenshots.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Localizing - To upload localized versions of a screenshot, drag and drop alternative
        versions on to an existing screenshot's thumbnail. Language name can be used as a suffix to
        hint to the UI which language this screenshot should be in (For example,
        foo_japanese.jpg)<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Mature Content - If your game has mature content, you should mark at least four screenshots
        as being suitable for all ages. Suitable screenshots should not contain gore, violence, or
        suggestive themes. These screenshots may be shown outside of your store page, such as on the
        front page. If you do not have enough screenshots flagged, your game may not appear in these
        places, even if it otherwise qualifies.

/><br /><br /><strong>Usage:</strong> This is the image that may be used in the background of your
store page.<br /><br /><strong>Design: </strong>This should be ambient so as not to compete with the
content on the page. A template will automatically be applied to your uploaded file. If you don't
upload your own, we'll automatically take the last screenshot and generate an appropriate background
image from that.<br /><br /><strong>Size: </strong> 1438px x 810px

Bundles use the same set of assets as other products on Steam, with one addition:

    title="civ6.jpg"
/><br /><br /><strong>Usage:</strong> This image appears at the top of the bundle detail page on
Steam.<br /><br /><strong>Design:</strong> This image should focus on the branding of your product.
For best results, please use the same artwork that you use for any retail box or marketing and make
sure the logo is clearly legible.<br /><br /><strong>Size:</strong> 707px x 232px<br />
