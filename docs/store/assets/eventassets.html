<h1>Event Graphical Assets</h1>
When creating and publishing new events using the Steam Event tools, you will be required to supply
a set of graphical assets for your event. These assets are used on the event page, as well as
various places on Steam, including your store page, Community Hub, and in the Steam Library. The
exact location of all communication depends on the type of event, user preferences, and the context
in which the event is displayed.<br /><br />

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Cover Image (Required)</h2>
<strong>Size:</strong> 800px wide x 450px tall<br /><strong>Design:</strong> This image should
primarily contain the artwork and branding for your event. Steam will always automatically include
your game's name and icon, so there's no need to put your game branding in the cover image.<br /><strong
    >Usage:</strong
>
It will appear on your store page in recent announcements, in lists of events and announcements, and
on your library detail page. It's used to link to your event/announcement and may be displayed
alongside content from multiple games, so the image should be clear and recognizable.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Header Image (Suggested)</h2>
<strong>Size:</strong> 1920px wide x 622px tall (please see template file for important notes)<br /><strong
    >Design:</strong
>
Add a rich header image to your detail page to communicate the theme or essence of your update or
announcement.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Library Spotlight Banner (Suggested)</h2>
<strong>Size:</strong> 2108px wide x 460px tall<br /><strong>Usage: </strong>If this is an important
event or announcement, you can upload a special Spotlight image to show the event large on your
gameâ€™s detail page and on the Library homepage.<br /><strong>Design:</strong> By default, your
event's title and subtitle will be laid on top of the right half of your spotlight image. You can
choose to turn off the text and use the entire banner space to show off your event or announcement.
