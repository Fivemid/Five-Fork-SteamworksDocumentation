<h1>Library Assets</h1>
As part of the release process on Steam, you will be required to deliver various graphical assets for your product. These assets are displayed in customer's libraries and in the community.<div class="bb_callout "><div><h3><strong>Templates</strong></h3>Download Photoshop templates for the library images here: <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/public/marketing/game_page_templates_v3.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://partner.steamgames.com/public/marketing/game_page_templates_v3.zip</a></div></div><h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Visibility</h2>Note that once uploaded, Library Assets are only visible for applications that have a published store page on Steam. If your store page is not published, Library Assets will not be visible in the Steam client.<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Library Capsule</h2><ul class="bb_ul "><li>Library capsule images should contain a readable product logo/name and have accurate dimensions.<br></li><li>Capsule images should not contain URLs, developer logos, or operating system/platform/store logos.<br></li><li>Capsule images should have PG-13 and under appropriate artwork.</li></ul><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/library_capsule_example2.jpg" alt="library_capsule_example2.jpg" title="library_capsule_example2.jpg"><br><br><strong>Usage:</strong> This image is primarily used in the library overview and collection views. <br><br><strong>Design:</strong> This should be graphically-centric and give the user some sense of the experience. Please use the key art and logo that is being used for any retail boxes or marketing. Avoid using quotes or other strings of text beyond the title of your application. The art should immediately tell the customer something important about your product. The logo should be easily legible against the background.<br><br><strong>Size:</strong> Please provide at ‘600px x 900px’.<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Library Details Page</h2>The hero graphic and the logo are layered and move independently when the page is scrolled, creating a subtle parallax effect. Consider how the product logo will be placed on top of the hero image (left bottom corner or centered). You’ll want to ensure the logo is both visible and legible against the background.<br><br><strong>Note:</strong> Higher resolution images are accepted and used for high resolution monitors. They are not required, but will be in the future.<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Hero Graphic</h2><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/Hero_example.jpg" alt="Hero_example.jpg" title="Hero_example.jpg"><br><br><strong>Usage:</strong> Appears at the top of a user’s library details page for this product. <br><br><strong>Design:</strong> This should be a visually rich image that is easily recognizable. For best results, please use the key art and logo that is being used for any retail boxes or marketing. Avoid using quotes or other strings of text. <br><br>At the center of the template is a “safe area” of 860px x 380px. This area will remain uncropped across scaling and resizing of the Steam client window. Artwork should extend across the entire template, but critical content should be within the safe area. For ex: a main character’s face should be entirely in the safe area or risk being cropped. <br><br><strong>Size: </strong>1920px x 620px PNG, or 3840px x 1240px (the higher res version will be required in the future)<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Logo</h2><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/Logo_example_1.png" alt="Logo_example_1.png" title="Logo_example_1.png"><br><br><strong>Usage:</strong> Appears at the top of a user’s library details page for this product, placed on top of the hero graphic. <br><br><strong>Design:</strong> For best results, use the logo that is being used for any retail boxes or marketing.
