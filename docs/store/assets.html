for your product. These are displayed in different places on the Steam store and in customer's
libraries.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Standard Assets</h2>

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Capsules</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Capsule Guidelines</h2>
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Store page capsule images should contain a readable product logo/name and have accurate
        dimensions.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Capsule images should not contain URLs or operating system/platform/store logos.<br /></li>
    <li>Capsule images should have PG-13 appropriate artwork.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Header Capsule</h2>
<img
    src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/header.jpg"
    alt="header.jpg"
    title="header.jpg"
/><br /><strong>Usage:</strong> This appears at the top of the store page, in the 'Recommended For
You' section, in 'Grid View' in the Steam client, in browse views on Big Picture mode, and for Daily
Deals if applicable.<br /><br /><strong>Design:</strong> This image should focus on the branding of
your product. For best results, please use the same artwork that you use for any retail box or
marketing and make sure the logo is clearly legible.<br /><br /><strong>Size:</strong> Please
provide '460px x 215px' . A '292px x 136px' image will be automatically generated from this.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Small Capsule</h2>
<img
    src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/capsule_231x87.jpg"
    alt="capsule_231x87.jpg"
    title="capsule_231x87.jpg"
/><br /><strong>Usage:</strong> These are used for all the lists throughout Steam. Search results,
top-sellers, new releases, etc. <br /><br /><strong>Design:</strong> These are small, so for best
results focus on making the logo clearly legible. <br /><br /><strong>Size:</strong> Please provide
'231px x 87px' image. From that, two smaller sizes (120x45 and 184x69) capsules are automatically
generated.<br /><br /><strong>Requirements: </strong>Small Capsule should contain readable logo,
even at smallest size. In most cases, this means your logo should nearly fill the small capsule.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Main Capsule</h2>
<img
    src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/capsule_616x353.jpg"
    alt="capsule_616x353.jpg"
    title="capsule_616x353.jpg"
/><br /><strong>Usage:</strong> This image appears at the top of the Steam store home page in the
Main Capsule carousel. <br /><br /><strong>Design:</strong> For best results, please use the key art
and logo that is being used for any retail boxes or marketing. Avoid using quotes or other strings
of text beyond the title of your game. The game's logotype should be easily legible against the
background. The art used for them should immediately tell the customer something important about the
game. It should be graphically-centric and give the user some sense of the game-play .Avoid placing
the logo/title in the lower right corner of the capsule image where it might be obscured by
promotional overlays.<br /><br /><strong>Size: </strong>616px x 353px
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="7"></a>Community Assets</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="8"></a>Community Icon</h2>
<strong>Usage:</strong> This small icon is used in the upper-left corner the store page and
community hub pages for your application. This icon will not appear properly on your store page
until your app is published as 'Coming Soon' or as fully released.
<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>
        Note: The Community Icon can be automatically generated from the Client Icon .ico file.
    </div>
</div>
<br /><strong>Size: </strong> 32px x 32px JPG
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="9"></a>Client Icon</h2>
<strong>Usage:</strong> This icon is used when creating desktop shortcuts to launch your
application. This icon can be used to supply the community icon and client image if desired.<br /><br /><strong
    >Size:</strong
>
32px x 32px ICO. You can also submit an ICO file with multiple sizes to accommodate scaling on
different resolutions.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="10"></a>Community Capsule</h2>
<strong>Usage:</strong> These capsules are used in the Steam Community when showing recent playtime
on a user's profile and when listing out apps on their wishlist. Typically, this is the same small
capsule that you upload to your store page. This capsule asset is also displayed in the Steam Client
Library List View.<br /><br /><strong>Size:</strong> 184px x 69px JPG
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="11"></a>Screenshots</h2>
<strong>Usage:</strong> Screenshots are displayed on your store page, and on other pages where your
game may be featured such as the Steam homepage. You must provide at least 5 screenshots of your
product.<br /><br /><strong>Design:</strong><br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Formatting - For best results, please provide screenshots in high-res, widescreen format.
        Any images you upload to the ‘screenshot’ section of your store page should be screenshots
        that show your game. This means avoiding using concept art, pre-rendered cinematic stills,
        or images that contain awards, marketing copy, or written product descriptions. For elements
        such as marketing copy, awards you’d like to show off, or descriptions of your Deluxe
        Edition, please use the specific spaces already available on your store page rather than
        including it in your screenshots.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Localizing - To upload localized versions of a screenshot, drag and drop alternative
        versions on to an existing screenshot's thumbnail. Language name can be used as a suffix to
        hint to the UI which language this screenshot should be in (For example,
        foo_japanese.jpg)<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Mature Content - If your game has mature content, you should mark at least four screenshots
        as being suitable for all ages. Suitable screenshots should not contain gore, violence, or
        suggestive themes. These screenshots may be shown outside of your store page, such as on the
        front page. If you do not have enough screenshots flagged, your game may not appear in these
        places, even if it otherwise qualifies.
    </li>
</ul>
<br /><strong>Size:</strong> 1280x720 or 1920x1080
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="12"></a>Page Background</h2>
<strong>Usage:</strong> This is the image that may be used in the background of your store page.<br /><br /><strong
    >Design: </strong
>This should be ambient so as not to compete with the content on the page. A template will
automatically be applied to your uploaded file. If you don't upload your own, we'll automatically
take the last screenshot and generate an appropriate background image from that.<br /><br /><strong
    >Size:
</strong>
1438px x 810px
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="13"></a>Bundle Assets</h2>
Bundles use the same set of assets as other products on Steam, with one addition:
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="14"></a>Package Header Image</h2>
<strong>Usage:</strong> This image appears at the top of the bundle detail page on Steam.<br /><br /><strong
    >Design:</strong

This image should focus on the branding of your product. For best results, please use the same
artwork that you use for any retail box or marketing and make sure the logo is clearly legible.<br /><br /><strong
    >Size:</strong
>
707px x 232px
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="override"></a>Artwork Overrides</h2>
<br />Artwork Overrides allow you to upload bespoke capsule images to market something specific in
your game, and then have those special images automatically expire after a set timespan. We
recommend you use this tool for major game updates, tournaments, or other time-sensitive events.<br /><br />See
