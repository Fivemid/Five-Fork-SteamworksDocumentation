<h1>Builds</h1>
A build is the result of uploading your content to steam, it can contain 1 or more of your depots
and is a representation of the content in those depots at that point in time.<br />
<br />
Builds are uploaded by developers using a command-line provided in the Steamworks SDK. A new build
of a depot may modify or remove any files which had been included in previous builds, or add new
files.<br />
<br />
See

for the complete in-depth guide.

A manifest is a listing of all the files which are included with a depot build, along with metadata
for all of the files, including the file size, SHA1 hash, and a set of flags. Manifests are output
as text files during the depot build process, and can be viewed from the

page in App Admin.

By default, the only branch defined is Default. If a game is already released, and you choose to set
a build live, anyone who owns the game will receive that update in that build (so make sure that
you're ready to release an update when you set it live).<br />
For unreleased games, setting a build live should have no impact on customers, since the game is
only owned by the Steam accounts in the Steamworks partner account (or by anyone who has redeemed a
Steam key for your game).<br />

If you have an update for a game that has already been released and you'd like to test it on Steam
servers, just create a beta branch of your app, optionally add a branch password (see below), and
set your update live on that branch.<br />

<br />
To protect branches you create with a password, click <strong>Update</strong> for a build and enter
a password into the field. Note that if you wish for branch contents to remain private, you should
set your branch password <i>before</i> setting a build live on the branch.<br />

<br />
To test game content from branches other than Default, right-click on the game in the Steam client
and select <strong>Properties</strong>. From the <strong>Properties</strong> window, click the
<strong>Betas</strong> tab.<br />
