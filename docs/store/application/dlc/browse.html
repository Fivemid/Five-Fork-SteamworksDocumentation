<h1>DLC Store Presence</h1>
If you have a game with DLC available for purchase on Steam, it will automatically appear on your
game's page and on a dedicated browsing page for all your game's DLC. These two areas include some
options for you as the developer to customize how your DLC appears.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>On Your Game's Store Page</h2>
On your game's store page, there is a specific place just below the purchase option which will
display up to 4 DLC items. You can control which items appear here, by modifying the order of items
in your edit store admin on the "Special Settings" tab. There will always be a 'see all' button in
this area, which leads to a dedicated browsing page for your game's DLC.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>On a dedicated DLC browse page</h2>
Any game that has DLC will automatically get a dedicated page for browsing that DLC. This offers
lists for Top Selling, New Releases, Upcoming, and discounted and provides for ways to customize
additional ways of organizing the DLC.<br /><br /><img

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Default Appearance</h2>
This browse page will automatically list your DLC with a couple of default logic. Here is a general
idea of what happens by default:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        The page will first list out the items that you specified to appear on your base game's
        store page.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If those items of DLC all have at least 4 screenshots, then weâ€™ll display all those items of
        DLC in big sections on the browse page, which shows the short description, price, and 4
        screenshot.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If not all the items have at least 4 screenshots, then we fall back to just showing a row of
        capsules.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Customization</h2>
You can customize these pages with a similar set of options that you have for configuring your
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/creator_homepage" class="bb_doclink"
    >developer or publisher homepages</a
>.<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        You can create lists of <i>n</i> number of DLC if you want to define logical sets of DLC
        that should be grouped together to help players shop for that kind of content.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        You can upload custom header image to give your page stronger branding or to draw greater
        attention to your latest DLC.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        You can select sets of DLC to feature, including automatically populated sets such as Top
        Sellers, New Releases, Discounted, and Upcoming. Or you can feature an individual item or a
        list that you created.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        You can also edit the set of tags in the tabbed area to hide irrelevant tags and apply tags
        that make sense for sorting your collection of DLC.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Social media links that you set for your base game will appear at the top of your DLC browse
        page. To set these links, visit the 'basic info tab in your edit store section of Steam.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>FAQ</h2>
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <h4>What does the follow button do?</h4>
        Clicking 'follow' at the top of the DLC browse page is the same as clicking 'follow' on your
        game page. Announcements that you as a developer post for this game will then appear in the
        activity feed of players that follow your game.
    </li>
