<h1>Release Process</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
The release of your product is mostly in your hands, though Valve will need to review and approve
your product before release. You can pick the date that it should release and you can configure most
features yourself. The general process for launching your product on Steam is displayed at the top
of your product landing page in Steamworks.<br /><br /><img

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Complete Release Checklists</h2>
There are two checklists, one part of the checklist is for your store page and one part is for your
product build and configuration. You can view your checklist on the right-hand side of the app
landing page. <br /><br />Once you have completed the checklist, you'll need to click "Mark as ready
for review" to communicate to Valve that you have completed the necessary work items and are ready
for your store page and proposed pricing to be reviewed. Please note that you'll need to submit your
store page for review before you can submit your build for review. Both checklists will need to be
completed, reviewed, and approved prior to release. You can check the

documentation for more information.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Your Store Presence</h2>
The Store Presence checklist consist of required items that need to be completed before you can list
the store page as
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/coming_soon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >coming soon</a
>
and for release. Once this checklist is finished, you'll be able to submit your store presence for
review by clicking "Mark as ready for review".
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Your Product Build</h2>
The Product Build checklist consist of required items to prepare your application for release on
Steam. Upload the build that you intended to release with to the default branch. Once you have
completed the app build checklist and feel that your application is ready to release, you can click
"Mark as ready for review" to communicate to Valve that you are ready for your product build to be
reviewed for release. Please note that you'll need to submit your store presence for review before
you can submit your build for review. <br /><br /><img

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Release Yourself When Ready</h2>
Once your page has been approved, you will need to use the green "Release App" button that appear on
the top of your product landing page in Steamworks at the time you wish to release your title.<br /><br />Approved
titles will not release themselves -- you need to use these controls yourself at the moment you wish
your product to be released. You can check our
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/types" class="bb_doclink">Release Options</a>
