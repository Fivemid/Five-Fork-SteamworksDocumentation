<h1>Supported Currencies</h1>
The currencies listed as "live" below are currently available to customers on
Steam. Currencies listed without being Live are ones where we collect prices and
plan to release at some point in the future. Only live currencies will be used
on the store and may be used for microtransactions.<br /><br />In countries
where we don't have the native currency available, prices are presented and
charged in US dollars, except for countries geographically located within Europe
where the Euro is used instead.<br /><br />We recommend a discounted USD price
in the Commonwealth of Independent States and affiliated countries where we
don't have local pricing. This is presented as a "CIS - USD" in the pricing
tools. These countries are: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan,
Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.<br /><br />We also recommend
a discounted USD price for several South Asian countries where we don't have
local pricing. This is presented as "SASIA-USD" in the pricing tools. These
countries are: Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.<br /><br />Unless
otherwise noted:<br />
