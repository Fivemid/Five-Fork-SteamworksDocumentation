<h1>Planning Your Sales Event</h1>
If you are organizing a sale landing page on Steam, here are some things to keep in mind when
scheduling and planning.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Example timeline</h2>
When planning a sales event, there are many factors that take time to coordinate and organize. As
such, we recommend that you start planning at least three months ahead of the date you wish to run
your event.<br />
<br />
Your specific event may have more or fewer moving parts than this example, but this should help give
you a general idea of timeline and some required milestones as you work with your contact at
Valve.<br />
<br />
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Time ahead</th>
        <th>Milestone</th>
    </tr>
    <br />
    <tr>
        <td>3 months</td>
        <td>
            Have a list of target games/developers that you plan to coordinate with. Have an overall
            plan for what the sale is, which games/devs are hypothetically participating, how the
            event will be described, any channels you plan to promote the event through, and any
            other details that help paint a picture of a compelling event.<br />
            <br />
            Share those details with your contact at Valve and we can discuss whether the event
            makes sense to run right now.

    <tr>
        <td>3 months</td>
        <td>
            If agreed upon with your Valve contact, start inviting developers to participate. In
            most cases, you'll need to instruct developers to enter their own custom discounts for
            each included game for the dates of the event.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2 months</td>
        <td>
            Remind participating developers to enter their discounts and to plan their livestreams
            or any other communication as relates to your event plan. Each participating game and
            developer can help amplify the overall event through their own communication channels,
            so be sure to think about how you can make the most of that. Provide participating
            developers with artwork they can use and wording they can use when speaking to their own
            audience about the event, either ahead of time or once the event has gone live.
