<h1>Themed Promotions</h1>
Occasionally game developers ask about hosting a themed promotion on Steam, gathering up and
promoting a set of games with a particular theme, style, setting, or genre. We're happy to consider
supporting these kinds of sales, but how we handle it will depend on the scope and nature of the
sale.<br /><br />Frequently the conversation starts when a game developer comes to us with a
relatively small set of games within a theme, often from other developers they know. It's possible
to host a narrow scoped exclusive event like this, but we'd have a hard time promoting this event on
the homepage of Steam.<br /><br />In order for a themed sale to get visibility on the homepage of
Steam, it would generally need to fit within these constraints:<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        <strong>Players need to be able to understand what the scope of the sale is.</strong> This
        is both in how the event is described to players and in the selection of games included in
        the event. For example, if an event is presented as "City-Builder Sale" but only includes 5
        city-building games, then players are going to be confused about where all the other
        city-builder games are and why it's only those 5 included.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Broadly described events should be as inclusive as reasonably possible.</strong> If
        the theme of the event is as broad as "City-Builder Sale" then we should talk about how to
        invite all of the city-builder games on Steam to participate. But if your event is narrow in
        focus, then it likely makes the most sense for your team to reach out individually to games
        that you think make sense to participate in your event.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Narrower events should be branded narrower.</strong> If the event will only include
        a subset of games in a category, then it might be better suited to framing the event as
        "Developer X and Friends" or some other way of making the connective elements between these
        games clear to players.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>How to design a themed promotion</h2>
To give the best chances of your promotion being successful and catching our attention, here are a
few things to keep in mind:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>Plan ahead</strong> - Typically, we suggest starting your planning a minimum of
        three months ahead of time. Bigger collections of games may need even more lead time to
        coordinate all of the participants.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Describe your whole plan</strong> - Are there other ways that you are considering
        spreading word of the event? Does the event coordinate with a holiday or some special event
        happening elsewhere? Describing a bigger picture of how your promotion would fit in with
        other activities helps us better understand the overall plan and how Steam could fit into
        that.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Describe the event hook</strong> - Sure you make games in a certain style or theme,
        but what are the notable titles that players have heard of and would make for a compelling
        hook? How does your event set itself apart from other similar events, in terms of design or
        special features for customers? Are the participating game developers interested in putting
        their games on discount? Are there interesting upcoming games that are also included?
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Rules</h2>
When you are thinking about putting together a themed sale, there are a couple of things for you to
know and agree to:<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        We can provide you with the necessary tools and documentation to assist you with the setup
        and organization of games within an event page. This will give you a space on Steam to
        display your games and organize by category, type, etc. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Unless specifically agreed upon with Valve, we cannot promise any specific Steam store
        visibility for the event. Marketing efforts would be 100% up to you and the individual game
        developers involved. In some cases, we choose to help promote events, but we usually can't
        make that call until closer to the event when we know which games you'll have participating
        and what the call-to-action is for players.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        It's fine to tell participants that your event will have a landing page on Steam, but you
        should not promise a specific level of visibility within your page or within Steam.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If your sale is presented as a general event about a broad theme of games, the event should
        be open to any game with the described theme, style, setting, or genre. Valve may modify
        your landing page to include additional games from devs that request participation, though
        in most cases we'll be communicating with you about those kinds of changes.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Don't sell access to getting listed on this page.<br /></li>
    <li>
        For small-scoped sales, the page will need to explain clearly what this sale is, and about
        the group that is organizing the promotion.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Any promotion on Steam is at the discretion of Valve. We generally would want to know the
        participating games, the scope of the event, any accompanying promotion, and any
        accompanying activities before we can decide whether and how much to promote the event.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If Valve chooses to promote your page within the Steam store:<br />
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>
                Broadcasting - We need to approve what broadcasting content will be shown. This is
                generally fine for industry talks or game announcement, but since we don't sell ad
                space on Steam, we want to be aware (as well as approve) of any kind of sponsorship
                logos or possibly ads for other brands or stores prior to the launch of the
                event.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Product page banner - this banner shows up on store pages of the apps that are
                included in the event and provides a bit of cross promotion value. This is a feature
                that we aren’t able to promise until the event launches, as it depends on other
                active promotions on Steam during that time. Those may take priority since only one
                banner can be shown per product and our partners currently don’t have an option to
                choose which one that would be. Logo ad placement in this banner is not allowed.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Access to the sale-building tools</h2>
Once we've agreed that your proposed event makes sense to run on Steam, we can grant you access to
the sale page editor tools. These tools allow you to define the list of participating games, create
sub-categories for organizing them (if appropriate) and uploading your custom artwork for the
background of the page and associated marketing banners.<br /><br />Here you can find a
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/resources/Sales_Feature_Beta" class="bb_doclink"
    >description of the editing tools</a
>.<br /><br />And the
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/event_tools/sale_pages_minimum"
    class="bb_doclink"
    >bare minimum assets needed</a
>
for a sale page: <br /><br />If we agree on setting up a sale landing page, it doesn't necessarily
mean that we'll be able to feature your event on the homepage of Steam.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Getting featured</h2>
Not every themed event can be featured in a big way on the homepage of Steam. Some really notable
themes with a lot of well-known releases can work well in a spot as a Weekend Deal. Some smaller
themes with a few well-known titles can get featured as a Daily Deal. Some other themes just don't
have a lineup that is compelling enough for us to justify featuring it to the entire platform of
customers.<br /><br />Before we can commit to promoting a themed sale event in a particular way, we
would want a pretty clear picture of which games are participating and will be on discount.
