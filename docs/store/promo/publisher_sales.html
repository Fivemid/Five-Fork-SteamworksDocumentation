<h1>Publisher or Developer Sales</h1>
Occasionally game developers or publishers ask about hosting a 'publisher sale' on Steam, gathering
up and discounting all of the games made or published by a certain company. We’re happy to share the
tools for setting up and hosting your own publisher sale, though for the most part we’re not able to
give the publisher sale front-page visibility. <br /><br />However, Steam is already set up to use
the power of your own catalog of games to promote your event. After setting up a sale page that
includes all of the games made by a developer or publisher, there is an optional ‘store banner’ that
can be configured. That clickable banner would then appear on top of each of your game’s store
pages, leading players back to your main sale page.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Rules</h2>
When you are thinking about putting together a publisher sale, there are a couple of things for you
to know and agree to:<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        We can provide you with the necessary tools and documentation to assist you with the setup
        and organization of games within an event page. This will give you a space on Steam to
        display your games and organize by category, type, etc. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Unless specifically agreed upon with Valve, we cannot promise any specific front-page store
        visibility for the event.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The page should explain clearly what this sale is, and about the group that is organizing
        the promotion.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If the sale and page is about promoting your developer or publisher's collection of games,
        then it should only include games from that developer or publisher.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Access to the sale-building tools</h2>
Once we've agreed that your proposed event makes sense to run on Steam, we can grant you access to
the sale page editor tools. These tools allow you to define the list of participating games, create
sub-categories for organizing them (if appropriate) and uploading your custom artwork for the
background of the page and associated marketing banners.<br /><br />Here you can find a

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Creating A New Sale Page</h2>
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/actions/GroupCreate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >Create a Steam Community group</a
        >
        with the name of your publisher or developer. You already have one if you set up a
        <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/creator_homepage" class="bb_doclink"
            >Developer Homepage</a
        >
        on Steam already.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Let your Valve contact know the URL of your group. Valve will enable the sale tools for an
        event under your group.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Event Visibility</h2>
Publisher sales are only promoted on the homepage of Steam under certain circumstances, where the
catalog of games has multiple top-performing titles. However, there are a couple of ways that Steam
can help your event be easily discovered by players.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="5"></a>Store Page Banners</h2>
Steam is already set up to use the power of your own catalog of games to promote your event. After
setting up a sale page that includes all of the games made by a developer or publisher, there is an
optional ‘store banner’ that can be configured. That clickable banner would then appear on top of
each of your game’s store pages, leading players back to your main sale page.<br /><br />When all of
your game's discounts go live, the players that wishlist any one of those games will get the usual
Steam wishlist notification and can easily find their way from that individual game via the store
page banner to your full publisher sale page.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Curated Deal On A Featured Game</h2>
Instead of featuring a publisher sale on the homepage of Steam, we are more likely to feature an
individual game or franchise if you have a game that qualifies for one of our curated discount
spots. In this case, we would use a Daily Deal, Midweek Madness, or Weekend Deal spot to feature
your best-selling game to drive player interest. Then the power of your store page banners (as
described above) would help those players find their way to the rest of your catalog.<br /><br />For
