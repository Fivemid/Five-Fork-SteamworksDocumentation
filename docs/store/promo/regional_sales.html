<h1>Regional Promotions</h1>
Occasionally game developers ask about hosting a regional promotion on Steam, gathering up and
promoting the games made in a certain city, region, or country. While we think these promotions are
a great way for players to learn more about where their games come from, and as a way to discover
new games, we aren't able to host every proposed event, nor can we treat every regional promotion in
the same way.<br /><br />Some regions have a much stronger line-up of titles and a much more robust
development community. These factors naturally lend themselves to a promotional event that is
relevant to a large portion of the Steam player base. Alternatively, some regions have a much
smaller development community and produce fewer titles, which makes it less likely that a promotion
would include multiple games of interest for many players.<br /><br />These events are typically
organized by a game development association or at least someone that is really well connected within
the local game development community and has the connections to ensure an inclusive event for all
devs in the region that wish to participate.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>How to design a regional promotion</h2>
To give the best chances of your promotion being successful and catching our attention, here are a
few things to keep in mind:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>Plan ahead</strong> - Typically, we suggest starting your planning a minimum of
        three months ahead of time. Bigger collections of games may need even more lead time to
        coordinate all of the participants.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Describe your whole plan</strong> - Are there other ways that you are considering
        spreading word of the event? Does the event coordinate with a national holiday or some
        special event happening elsewhere? Describing a bigger picture of how your promotion would
        fit in with other activities helps us better understand the overall plan and how Steam could
        fit into that.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Describe the event hook</strong> - Sure you make games in a particular location, but
        what are the notable titles that players have heard of and would make for a compelling hook?
        How does your event set itself apart from other similar events, in terms of design or
        special features for customers? Are the participating game developers interested in putting
        their games on discount? Are there interesting upcoming games that are also included?
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Rules</h2>
When you are thinking about putting together a regional event for your city/state/country, there are
a couple of things for you to know and agree to:<br />
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        We can provide you with the necessary tools and documentation to assist you with the setup
        and organization of games within an event page. This will give you a space on Steam to
        display your games and organize by category, type, etc. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        We can't promise any specific Steam store visibility for the event. Marketing efforts would
        be 100% up to you and the individual game developers involved. In some cases, we choose to
        help promote events, but we usually can't make that call until closer to the event when we
        know which games you'll have participating and what the call-to-action is for players.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        It's fine to tell participants that your event will have a landing page on Steam, but you
        should not promise a specific level of visibility within your page or within Steam.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The event should be open to any game created in the defined city/region/country. Valve may
        modify your landing page to include additional games from devs that request participation,
        though in most cases we'll be communicating with you about those kinds of changes.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Don't sell access to getting listed on this page.<br /></li>
    <li>
        The page will need to explain clearly what and where this region is, and about the group
        that is organizing the promotion<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If Valve chooses to promote your page within the Steam store:<br />
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>
                Broadcasting - We need to approve what broadcasting content will be shown. This is
                generally fine for industry talks or game announcement, but since we don't sell ad
                space on Steam, we want to be aware (as well as approve) of any kind of sponsorship
                logos or possibly ads for other brands or stores prior to the launch of the
                event.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Product page banner - this banner shows up on store pages of the apps that are
                included in the event and provides a bit of cross promotion value. This is a feature
                that we aren’t able to promise until the event launches, as it depends on other
                active promotions on Steam during that time. Those may take priority since only one
                banner can be shown per product and our partners currently don’t have an option to
                choose which one that would be. Logo ad placement in this banner is not allowed.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="3"></a>Access to the sale-building tools</h2>
Once we've agreed that your proposed event makes sense to run on Steam, we can grant you access to
the sale page editor tools. These tools allow you to define the list of participating games, create
sub-categories for organizing them (if appropriate) and uploading your custom artwork for the
background of the page and associated marketing banners.<br /><br />Here you can find a
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/resources/Sales_Feature_Beta" class="bb_doclink"
    >description of the editing tools</a
>.<br /><br />And the
<a
    href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/event_tools/sale_pages_minimum"
    class="bb_doclink"
    >bare minimum assets needed</a
>
for a sale page: <br /><br />If we agree on setting up a sale landing page, it doesn't necessarily
mean that we'll be able to feature your event on the homepage of Steam.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="4"></a>Getting featured</h2>
Not every regional event can be featured in a big way on the homepage of Steam. Some really notable
regions with a lot of well-known releases can work well in a spot as a Weekend Deal. Some smaller
regions with a few well-known titles can get featured as a Daily Deal. Some other regions just don't
have a lineup that is compelling enough for us to justify featuring it to the entire platform of
customers.<br /><br />Before we can commit to promoting a regional sale event in a particular way,
we would want a pretty clear picture of which games are participating and will be on discount.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Organic Visibility</h2>
Steam is already built to take advantage of the network effects of running such a sale: When you put
together your sale page and include games that have agreed to participate, you can set up a "store
page banner" which will appear on each of the participating games’ store pages. When your
participating games kick of their own discounts, players can easily find their way from individual
games back to your main event page to find all of the related games.
