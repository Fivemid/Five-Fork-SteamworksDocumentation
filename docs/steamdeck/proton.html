<h1>Steam Deck and Proton</h1>
Proton is the compatibility layer that allows Windows games to run on Linux by using a modified
version of Wine and a collection of high-performance graphics API implementations. The team has been
working on and improving Proton for a while now, and it has a large amount of coverage. Most APIs
are already supported by Proton, and most games work out of the box. We're continuing to improve
Proton compatibility, and our goal is to get as close to full coverage as possible.<br /><br />To
test your game’s Proton compatibility, you will need a Linux environment. You can install Linux and
Steam on a machine to test, or request a developer kit once they are available (limited quantities).
Once you are set up in your Linux environment / developer kit, you will be able to use the provided
debugging tools to run game builds through a remote debugger and profile performance. Access to the
tools is still a work-in-progress and this page will be updated with more information in the coming
days.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Known Proton Issues</h2>
<br />Below are a few recommendations around areas that have been known to be Proton compatibility
issues and likely to induce delays in Proton fully supporting a given title after it launches on
Steam:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        .NET / WPF: Our recommendation is to use standalone technologies like Qt for launchers
        instead of OS-dependent frameworks like .NET / WPF. For best results, skip separate
        launchers altogether and integrate their functionality into the game client UI instead,
        where controller support is likely better.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Media Foundation: To save additional bandwidth and disk use, we recommend using standalone
        codecs like VP9.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Anti-cheat: We recommend using user-space anti-cheat components for best results, as they
        can typically run in the Wine environment and provide the same level of functionality.
        Kernel-space solutions are not currently supported and are not recommended. Note: we have
        been working with most anti-cheat technology providers to provide Proton compatibility. If
        your solution currently isn't working, please reach out to both your vendor and Valve for
        support.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Anti-tamper / DRM: In general we don't recommend use of such solutions across any PC
        platforms, as they may impact disk usage and overall performance. Getting them fully
        functional in the Wine environment can take some time and add significant latency to getting
        your title supported.
    </li>
</ul>

<br />You can test your game on Proton now, by setting up a Linux test environment. It's free--all
you need is a PC.<br /><br />
