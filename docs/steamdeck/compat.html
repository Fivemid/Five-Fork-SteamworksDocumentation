<h1>Steam Deck Compatibility Review Process</h1>
With the release of Steam Deck, we're bringing the Steam library to a new portable form factor. An
important part of this transition is helping customers understand how specific Steam titles will
function on Deck. While your game may run great on Deck without any work from you, itâ€™s also
possible that the shift to a portable form factor will impact the experience. We've designed a
system to show at a glance how games will play on Deck, giving developers specific criteria to
target, and making it easy for customers to find seamless, comfortable experiences.<br /><br />At
the core of this system is a compatibility review process that's similar in structure to the
existing Steam build review process:<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Valve will review your game on Steam Deck, checking it against a specific set of criteria.
        (See

        below.)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        When the review completes, you'll be provided detailed point-by-point results through the
        partner site.<br />
    </li>
    <li>You'll have a window of time to review these results before they're published.<br /></li>
    <li>
        Once published, customers will be able to see the results of your compatibility testing when
        browsing games in their library or the store.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />The results of a compatibility review will not affect whether your game is available to
customers on Deck, but will affect how it is presented.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Deck Compatibility Ratings</h2>
Many games work great as-is on Deck. Some games may require manual user configuration, or may only
be relevant to users with specific setups. Other games may not be a good experience due to the shift
to a portable form factor or an incompatibility with Steam Deck's software/hardware stack. The core
goal of the compatibility review process is making it clear to customers at a glance which of these
groups each game fits into by assigning a badge to each:<br /><br />

While Steam Deck is a fully-functional PC, we anticipate the most common use cases will be different
from a standard desktop. In order to receive the

<strong>Verified on Deck</strong> badge, you need to meet all of the following criteria, aimed at
helping customers feel comfortable playing your game on Deck. Most failures in this category will
cause your game to appear with a
<img
    src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/playable_18.png"
    alt="Playable badge"
    title="Playable badge"
/>
<strong>Playable</strong> badge.<br /><br /><strong>Input</strong><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>controller support</strong>: your game must support Steam Deck's physical controls.
        The default controller configuration must provide users with the ability to access all
        content. Players must not need to adjust any in-game settings in order to enable controller
        support or this configuration.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>controller glyphs</strong>: when using Steam Deck's physical controls, on-screen
        glyphs must either match Deck button names, or match Xbox 360/One button names. Mouse and
        keyboard glyphs should not be shown if they are not the active input. Interacting with any
        physical Deck controls using the default configuration must not show non-controller glyphs.

            user is using.</i
        >)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>text input</strong>: if your game requires text input (eg., for naming a character
        or a save file), you must either use a
        <a

            >Steamworks API for text entry</a
        >
        to open the on-screen keyboard for players using a controller, or have your own built-in
        entry that allows users to enter text in their language using only a controller.
    </li>
</ul>
<br /><strong>Display</strong><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>resolution support</strong>: the game must run at a resolution supported by Steam
        Deck. (<i
            >Recommendations: Whenever possible, we recommend you support the Deck's native
            resolutions of 1280x800 (preferred) or 1280x720.</i
        >)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>default configuration</strong>: the game must ship with a default configuration on
        Deck that results in a playable framerate.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>text legibility</strong>: interface text must be easily readable at a distance of 12
        inches/30 cm from the screen. In other words, the smallest on-screen font character should
        never fall below 9 pixels in height at 1280x800. (<i
            >Recommendations: We expect Steam Deck will be used in a wide variety of lighting and
            physical configurations. We recommend supporting user-configurable text size and, when
            possible, contrast. While 9px is the absolute minimum text size for approval, we
            recommend aiming for 12px whenever possible.</i
        >)
    </li>
</ul>
<br /><strong>Seamlessness</strong><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>no device compatibility warnings</strong>: the app must not present the user with
        information that the Deck software (ie., specific Linux distribution) or hardware (ie., GPU)
        is unsupported.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>launchers</strong>: for games with launchers, those launchers also must meet the
        requirements listed here, including full navigability with a controller. (<i
            >Recommendations: We recommend strongly against requiring the user to navigate a
            launcher to play your game.</i
        >)
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Proton Requirements</h2>
Proton is a Windows compatibility layer. On Deck, games without native Linux builds will be run
through Proton, a set of tools that will automatically take your current Windows executable and game
data and run them on Steam Deck's Linux-based OS.<br /><br />Proton is a work in progress, and it's
possible that your game may not yet be fully supported. If your game's Steam Deck compatibility
review turns up blocking bugs or performance problems specific to Proton, those issues will be added
to our internal issue tracking system and your game will appear with an
<img
    src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/unsupported_18.png"
    alt="Unsupported badge"
    title="Unsupported badge"
/>
<strong>Unsupported</strong> badge. Once the issues have been resolved, we'll automatically notify
you and re-test your game.
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Library And Steam Store</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="6"></a>Library</h2>
A user's library on Steam Deck is an extension of their existing library, and vice versa. All games
a user owns will automatically appear in their library on the Steam Deck when they first log in.
Games purchased on any device will appear in their library on other devices.<br /><br />As on other
platforms, users can filter and sort their library by name, installed state, etc. In addition to
these common options, on Steam Deck users can sort and filter by Deck compatibility.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="7"></a>Steam Store On Deck</h2>
The default view of the store on Steam Deck is different from the standard desktop view. While
generally the same general sections and presentation exist (eg., main capsule, community
recommendations, top sellers), all views contain exclusively games that are
<img
    src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/verified_18.png"
    alt="Verified badge"
    title="Verified badge"
/>
<strong>Verified on Deck</strong>. All games that meet the Verified on Deck criteria will
automatically be added to this view; no additional action needs to be taken by partners.
<br /><br />The broader Steam store is also easily accessible on Steam Deck and includes all Steam
store functionality and products available in the customer's region. Customers browsing the Steam
store on Deck aren't prevented from viewing or purchasing content that may not work well on their
device (examples: VR titles, keyboard-centric games). In these cases, store pages provide details
based on the compatibility review about what customers can expect if they do try to run these
products on a Deck.<br /><br /><img

/><br /><br />There are three different ways a game can be added to the queue to be reviewed:<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        You can manually request a review for an upcoming or a back-catalog title by using the
        "Steam Deck Compatibility Review" link in the Technical Tools sections of your app landing
        page. (Note: not all partners have access to the review request tool yet. We're increasing
        the number of partners with access over time.)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        When a back-catalog title meets certain automated heuristics, it will automatically be added
        to the review queue with no need for you to submit a manual request. You'll receive a
        notification when this happens.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        When Valve identifies a game as important to Steam Deck customers, we may sometimes add
        games to the review queue with no need for you to submit a manual request. You'll receive a
        notification when this happens.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />When a compatibility review for your game completes, you'll receive an automated email,
similar to store page and build review notifications. At the same time, detailed point-by-point
information will be available for review on the partner site.<br /><br />Once this happens, you have
a few options:<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        You can choose to publish the compatibility review results. (Publishing these results is
        separate from and will not interfere with publishing your store or Steamworks settings.)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If you want to make changes in response to the test results (eg., adding a default
        controller configuration, hooking up a keyboard API call, etc.), you can publish a new build
        and request a re-review.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If you believe there are errors in the test results, you can respond to the test results
        directly through the partner site to ask for or present additional information.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />If you take no action, after approximately a week your review results will automatically be
published and show up on your game detail page as the "results of Valve's testing" (see
<a href="http://%22#SteamStoreOnDeck" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Steam Store on Deck</a>
section above).<br /><br /><img

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="9"></a>FAQ</h2>
<br /><strong>What application types are eligible for compatibility review?</strong><br />At this
time, this process is only available for games. There is no compatibility review process for other
app types, eg., DLC, tools, or soundtracks, other than in exceptional cases.<br /><br /><strong
    >How long does it take to complete a compatibility review once my game is in the queue?</strong
><br />We're aiming for compatibility reviews to be completed and results available to partners
within a week of submission. We expect review time will fluctuate based on the current size and
complexity of the other titles in the queue.<br /><br /><strong
    >Will the compatibility review process, or my test results, affect my normal Steam
    release?</strong
><br />The compatibility review queue is entirely separate from the normal Steam release review
process. The results of your compatibility review will not affect your broader Steam release in any
way.<br /><br /><strong
    >Can I get my game reviewed for compatibility before the initial release?</strong
><br />Yes, you can request compatibility reviews for unreleased titles.<br /><br /><strong
    >I believe my game isn't a good fit for Deck. Can I stop my game from showing up in the Deck
    store and library?</strong
><br />Removing products available on Steam from the Deck store or library isn't a supported
feature. The Deck is an extension of Steam onto a new portable PC form factor, and so customers both
expect and have access to the same store and library that they would on any other PC.<br /><br />While
it's possible for players to hook up a keyboard or a monitor, we believe most customers will be
treating the Deck like a handheld appliance, most of the time. Because of this, one of the goals of
the

<strong>Verified on Deck</strong> badge is helping customers easily understand how well any game
plays with just the standard Deck hardware configuration and no peripherals.<br /><br />Though this
may be the most common customer use case, it isn't the only one. As with Steam in general, rather
than completely restricting access to some products, we want to enable customers to find the right
products given their specific goals and desires.<br /><br /><strong
    >Are there other, non-blocking recommendations for my game to play great on Deck?</strong
