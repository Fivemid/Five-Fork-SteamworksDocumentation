<h1>Steam Deck Developer Kits</h1>
We are allocating a portion of our EV2 (engineering verification test build) units for partners to
test their titles.<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Functionally, these units are identical to the Steam Decks that will be shipping to
        customers later this year. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Cosmetically these units will differ a bit from the shipping product, but this shouldnâ€™t
        impact testing.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Software is still in the works, and developer kits will receive updates periodically leading
        up to launch.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />We are building these right now, and quantities will be limited. Once available, partners will
be able to request a dev-kit from the partner site hardware request form. We will keep track of all
units requested, as more dev kits will be available as we get closer to launch.<br /><br />More info
about the developer kit program coming soon.<br /><br /><br /><img
