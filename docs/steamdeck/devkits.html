<h1>Steam Deck Developer Kits</h1>
We are allocating a portion of our EV2 (engineering verification test build) units for partners to
test their titles.<br /><br />Some quick notes:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Functionally, these units are identical to the Steam Decks that will be shipping to
        customers later this year. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Cosmetically these units will differ a bit from the shipping product, but this shouldnâ€™t
        impact testing.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Software is still in the works, and developer kits will receive updates periodically leading
        up to launch.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />We're thrilled to announce that Steam Deck dev kits are ready to ship, and we've opened up the
Steam Deck Dev Kit request form. As a Steam developer, you can go to the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >hardware request form</a
>
to request a Steam Deck Dev Kit. Fill out the form and be sure to read through the agreement and dev
kit guidelines. Dev kit supplies are limited, so we'll be reviewing requests via the online form on
a case by case basis and will be shipping them out as quickly as possible.<br /><br />Dev kit
