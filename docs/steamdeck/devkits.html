<h1>Steam Deck Developer Kits</h1>
We are allocating a portion of our EV2 (engineering verification test build) units for partners to
test their titles.<br /><br />Some quick notes:<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Functionally, these units are identical to the Steam Decks that will be shipping to
        customers later this year. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Cosmetically these units will differ a bit from the shipping product, but this shouldn’t
        impact testing.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Software is still in the works, and developer kits will receive updates periodically leading
        up to launch.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />We're thrilled to announce that Steam Deck dev kits are ready to ship, and we've opened up the
Steam Deck Dev Kit request form. As a Steam developer, you can go to the
<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >hardware request form</a
>
to request a Steam Deck Dev Kit. Fill out the form and be sure to read through the agreement and dev
kit guidelines. <br /><br />Dev kit supplies are limited, so we'll be reviewing requests via the
online form on a case by case basis and will be shipping them out as quickly as possible.<br /><br /><strong
    >Notes for developers receiving dev-kits</strong
><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        Your kit may arrive with little / no power – if that’s the case you’ll need to plug it in so
        it can get some charge and boot up.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Speaking of power, all of our dev-kits come with a US plug type 45W power supply. This means
        that if you’re outside of the USA, you’ll most likely need a travel adapter to charge and
        use your dev-kit. (We can’t guarantee it’ll charge with anything other than the included
        power supply at this stage)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        To connect your development PC to your Steam Deck, you’ll need the SteamOS Devkit Client
        software from Steam. You can download this directly from this link:
        <a href="steam://install/943760">steam://install/943760</a> – just make sure Steam is
        running when you click that. Learn how to use this software here:

<br /><strong>Media sharing policy</strong><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        You are welcome to share photos, videos, and posts about Steam Deck Dev-Kit hardware so long
        as you keep it to your own title's gameplay.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Please don't share media of the SteamOS UI, as this software is still undergoing work ahead
        of launch.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        In addition, please don't share media of other games on Deck as a courtesy to other game
        developers - unless you have express permission.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Finally, please do not share hardware with or talk to press about the Steam Deck dev-kit.
    </li>
</ul>
<br /><strong>Note</strong><br /><br />Hardware and software are not yet final; freezes and crashes
may occur. If your dev-kit has crashed, you may need to perform a hard reboot. Press and hold the
power button until the light turns off to power off (this should take about 5 seconds), then press
the power button once to power it on.<br /><br />Please report these issues on the forums if they
are happening regularly so the team can address them.<br /><br /><br /><img
