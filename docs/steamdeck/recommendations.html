<h1>Developing for Steam Deck</h1>
There are a few things you can do right now to make your game better on Steam Deck, without a
developer kit.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="1"></a>Input</h2>
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        If your game is controller-enabled, plug a controller into your computer, and play your game
        from startup. Take note when there are moments where you have to reach for your keyboard or
        mouse (launchers, for instance).<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If your game is not controller-enabled, look into setting a Steam Input default
        configuration with an intuitive control scheme.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Use ISteamUtils::ShowGamepadTextInput() for in-game text fields.<br /></li>
    <li>
        If your game has support for both mouse-style (1:1 movement without filtering) and
        joystick-style camera movement, making sure they can work at the same time will provide a
        better experience for trackpad and gyro users. Common problems include joystick input
        getting locked out when mouse camera is used and vice versa, controller buttons not working
        when mouse camera is being used, on-screen button prompts changing between controller and
        keyboard/mouse icons. We recommend allowing mouse events to affect the camera as they
        normally would without perturbing simultaneous controller functionality, and only switching
        to mouse/keyboard mode if a mouse click event is received.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Fully integrate with the Steam Input API for best results.</li>

        to test Proton compatibility.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        We recommend targeting Vulkan as your primary graphics API for best performance and battery
        life. If you use an engine like Unity or Unreal, enable Vulkan in your build for all users,
        and report any performance or functional differences from the DirectX version to your engine
        vendor. However, if Vulkan would be a secondary path with lower performance, doing this work
        is not typically worth it, as Proton DirectX translation performance is likely to exceed
        untranslated Vulkan in this case.

<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Steam Integration</h2>
<ol class="bb_ol">
    <li>
        Support Steam Cloud. This feature will allow players to start a game on their PC and
        continue it seamlessly on Steam Deck - or vice versa.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Support Offline Mode: test your game without any online connectivity, including first run on
        a new Steam account.
    </li>
