<h1>How to load and run games on the Steam Deck Dev-Kit</h1>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="1"></a>Overview</h2>
To help developers work with Steam Deck, we are providing the
<strong>SteamOS Devkit Client Tool</strong> and the <strong>SteamOS Devkit Service</strong>. These
tools allow you to load game builds directly from your development machine to your Steam Deck
Dev-kit (or Linux machine), as well as perform other development activities.
<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>
        <strong>Important: </strong><br />Before uploading and testing your own title using the
        instructions below, we recommend installing and running another title from Steam that uses
        Steam Play(Proton) on the Steam Deck dev-kit. This will ensure all Proton and its
        dependencies are installed.

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="2"></a>Install Tools</h2>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="3"></a>Client Setup (Dev PC side)</h2>
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        The <strong>SteamOS Devkit Client</strong> runs on your development PC and allows developers
        to connect to a Steam Deck or Linux system to deploy / debug software. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Install SteamOS Devkit Client from Steam. Check with your Valve contact for keys. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The tool can be started from the Steam client interface, in the Software category. If you
        prefer to run it from the command line:<br />
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>
                On Windows, run
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">windows-client/devkit-gui.exe</code
                ><br />
            </li>
            <li>
                On Linux,
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight"
                    >run python3.9 ./devkit-gui-cp39.pyz</code
                >
                in the
                <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">linux-client</code> directory
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="4"></a>Server Setup (Steam Deck side)</h2>
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        The <strong>SteamOS Devkit Service</strong> runs on the target Steam Deck / Linux system,
        and allows developers to connect from another PC and deploy / debug their software.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If you have a Steam Deck dev-kit, the SteamOS Devkit Service is pre-installed and running -
        no further action is needed.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If you do not have a Steam Deck and are testing from your own Linux system, you will need to
        install the SteamOS Devkit Service and launch it manually. Check with your Valve contact for
        keys.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="5"></a>Connecting to Deck</h2>
On your Dev PC, launch the SteamOS Dev-kit Client. The dev-kit needs to be on a local area network
allowing Multicast DNS with the development host in order to be discovered and listed. This works
over Wi-Fi or ethernet (via a USB-C hub).<br /><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>On your Steam Deck</strong>: Go to Settings &gt; System, and select
        <strong>Pair new host </strong>under the Development Kit section<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>On your Dev PC:</strong> In the Devkit tool, look for an item called callistoXXX -
        this is your dev-kit. Click the <strong>Register</strong> button to the right to register
        this devkit with the tool. (This sets up a ssh key on the device and grants full
        control.)<br />
    </li>
    <li><strong>On your Steam Deck</strong>: Approve the pairing request from your PC.<br /></li>
    <li>
        If you don't see a dev-kit in the dev-kit tool UI, check to make sure your dev pc and
        dev-kit are on the same LAN. Depending on your environment, you may have to use the
        <strong>Add by IP</strong> field.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="6"></a>Uploading a game build to Steam Deck</h2>
Click the <strong>Title Upload</strong> tab to configure a game for upload from your dev PC to the
Steam Deck dev-kit. The screen looks something like this when filled out:<br /><br /><img
    src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/dev-kit_upload_2.png"
    alt="dev-kit_upload_2.png"
    title="dev-kit_upload_2.png"
/><br /><br />This screenshot is an example of uploading a Windows build of a test game to the
devkit.<br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
        <strong>Local Folder</strong> - The base directory that contains all the files necessary for
        your game to run..<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Exclude patterns</strong> - The upload process uses rsync over ssh, so to prevent
        unneeded directories and files present in <strong>Local Folder</strong> from being
        transferred, populate the <strong>Exclude patterns</strong> field (space separated--see
        <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >exclude patterns</a
        >).<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Clean upload</strong> - Enable this to delete any files on the devkit that are not
        present in the <strong>Local Folder</strong> once the exclude patterns are applied.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Devkit Start Command</strong> - Set this to game's binary executable (and any
        arguments you want to add).<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Steam Play</strong> - Check this if you are uploading Windows binaries that need to
        be executed over Steam Play using Proton.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Steam Play debug</strong> = The debugger service checkbox allows you to step through
        your C++ build in Visual Studio.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bb_section"><a name="7"></a>Running uploaded game builds</h2>
On your Steam Deck devkit, navigate the library to find a new title named 'Devkit Game:
YourGameName' and select it to run.
<div class="bb_callout">
    <div>
        As mentioned at the top of the article, before uploading and testing your own title
        directly, we recommend installing another title from Steam that uses Steam Play (Proton) on
        the Steam Deck devkit and running it first. This will ensure Proton and all its dependencies
        are properly installed.
