<h1>Distributing Source Engine Games / Mods</h1>
A <strong>modification</strong>, often abbreviated to <strong>mod</strong>, is an alteration or
creation of files for a game engine, which allow it to modify the gameplay style, graphics,
environments, models, etc. <br />
Many of Valve's first-party games are shipped with a software development kit or SDK in order to
facilitate the development of mods. <br />
While the general legal terms under which our games can be used for modding are provided in the
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
    >Steam Subscriber Agreement</a
>
and sometimes with the modding tools we supply, there are some recurring questions we get from the
community about mods, especially when they are meant to ship on Steam. <br />
<br />
Our expectation for mods is that by default they are non-commercial in nature and are based on the
official SDK for one of our games.
<h4>Non-commercial</h4>
By non-commercial we mean that anyone who owns the Valve-developed base game may download and play
the mod without having to pay for it.<br />
It is ok for a mod team to accept <strong>donations</strong> from its users so long as the access to
the mod or features thereof is not dependent on making a donation. <br />
Including paid <strong>advertising</strong> in your mod makes it commercial.
<h4>Based on the Official SDK</h4>
We supply SDKs with many of our games. These are the approved basis for modding our games. It is not
ok to ship a mod that is based on leaked or stolen source code. <br />
As long as you follow these guidelines you may freely distribute your mod through Steam, via your
own website or any third-party service without getting a separate license from Valve.

            Q. I wish to distribute a Source Engine Mod through Steam. Should I fill out the

        >to get signed up as a Steamworks developers. All information is required, including bank
        and tax information and app fee even if you intend to distribute your mod for free.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q. Is there a licensing fee for using the Source Engine?</h4>
        <strong>A.</strong> There is no fee for using the Source Engine for your free mod, but there
        may be licensing fees for included tools if you charge money for your game.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q. Do I have to buy a Havok license?</h4>
        <strong>A.</strong> In the past it was necessary for commercial mods based on the Source
        Engine to purchase a separate license to the Havok physics engine, but that is no longer the
        case as Microsoft has generously waived their licensing fee. For non-commercial mods this
        was never necessary.<br />
        <br />
        However, if you are using the RAD tools included with the Source SDK, you will need to
        contact RAD for information and cost associated with licensing Miles and/or Bink.<br />

        <h4>
            Q. Iâ€™ve got a Source mod that I want to distribute via Steam. How do I prepare my mod
            under my app ID?
        </h4>
        <strong>A.</strong> You'll need to copy the exe and content from the Valve Source Engine
        game you have built your mod off and wrap that up as your application.<br />
        <br />
        While you should include all the necessary Source Engine dlls and content from the base
        Source game that you need for your mod to run, Source Engine mods must be configured to
        require ownership of the base game in order to play. This needs to be configured by
        Valve.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q. I wish to use Steam achievements in my mod. How do I do that?</h4>
        <strong>A.</strong> Use the
        <code class="bb_code bb_code_inline nohighlight">CAchievementMgr</code> class included in
        the Source Engine after configuring achievements in your App Admin page on the partner site.

    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q. How does the dedicated server work for my game?</h4>
        <strong>A.</strong> You will need a new dedicated server app ID so that you can create
        depots that are for a dedicated server. Once you've got an app ID for your base game, you
        can create your own dedicated server app ID. From your app landing page in Steamworks, click
        "All Associated Packages, DLC, Demos, And Tools" and then click the "Create New Tool" button
        in the Tools section.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q. Can I use Valve IP in my Source Mod?</h4>
        <strong>A.</strong> Yes. However, please make it clear on your store pages that your mod is
        a mod and not created by Valve. Commercial games and mods that include Valve IP such as
        characters and story-lines need prior approval from Valve.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q. Can I use multiple Valve IPs in one Source Mod?</h4>
        <strong>A.</strong> Yes. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q: How can I get source code access from Valve?</h4>
        <strong>A.</strong> We have in the past granted access to the source code of some of our
        games to a small number of modding teams who could demonstrate a need that could not be met
        by the SDK. We may do this again in the future under exceptional circumstances but because
        of the associated support burden and risk of leaks our default answer is to develop based on
        the SDK. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q: Can I sell my mod on Steam / outside of Steam?</h4>
        <strong>A.</strong> We receive this question quite regularly but very rarely permit mods to
        be sold, the reason being that it sets an expectation that Valve has assigned a level of
        oversight and quality control over the development and ongoing support of the mod that we
        are unable to provide. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>
            Q: Does my mod have to require ownership of the (modded) base game when I distribute my
            mod on Steam?
        </h4>
        <strong>A.</strong> This depends. If your mod is essentially an improvement or extension of
        the underlying game then we will require the ownership of this base game. However, if you
        are distributing a total conversion mod that does not use our games' assets or your mod is
        otherwise a completely separate experience from the base game then we may let it ship on
        Steam without additional formal dependencies. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q: Why are there mods on Steam that do not follow these rules?</h4>
        <strong>A.</strong> Our approach has evolved over time and the projects you are thinking
        about have been grandfathered in. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q: What about mods for games on Steam that were not developed by Valve?</h4>
        <strong>A.</strong> Please contact the publisher of the game in question directly. <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Q. Where can I learn more about Source Engine development?</h4>
        <strong>A.</strong> The best place to start is on the
