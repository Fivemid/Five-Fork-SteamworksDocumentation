<h1>Tip - Renaming a live exe</h1>
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="1"></a>Situation</h2>
You've got a released game with customers already playing it and you need to rename your exe.
<h2 class="bb_subsection"><a name="2"></a>Solution</h2>
The order of operations can matter here, as setting a build live doesn’t go through the publish
process but changing the launch options does. If it’s only a few seconds between the two, it’s
unlikely to impact many people as Steam will force an update when the user goes to launch and that
should grab the latest launch options. Assuming that there’s a build update associated with the
change, we recommend setting the build live and then immediately publishing the app admin settings
with the launch option change.<br />
<br />
If you’re particularly worried, you could duplicate the EXE (with both names) for the transition
build and push that live well before you make the launch option change. This would ensure that
clients have time to grab the new build (while still being able to launch) before the launch option
change came through.
